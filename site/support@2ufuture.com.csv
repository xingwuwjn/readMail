 Dear friend


   Thanks for your interesting,

   We ship directly from the factory,and because there has so many order need to pick and pack,so we have not start to delivery ,but the tracking number has been give  to you, we'll speed up the delivery of the package to your home as soon as possible.

   This is your tracking number: XM9J87320709

   And you can check it from this link:https://www.trackingmore.com/cn.html

   This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our fulfillment center to the destination. International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.

*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.

   If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your  patience

qq,Denis Lafrenière,d.lafreniere@tlb.sympatico.ca,Order # 3397,2019-01-17,"       Hello! 
       Is it possible to have the shipping date of my order and the shipping number. What is happening and why have such a long delay for such an order? I would like to have a straight answer since I still expect to have this order soon. Winter has already started and I plan to receive it and use it this year. 
           I look forward to receiving news from you very soon...

qq,,ray@peakmarket.com,FW: Order Notification,2019-01-16,"Hello,

 

I placed this order on November and it is January 15, 2019 already, I tried to tract this order but the order is not found. Whenever I used the tracking system to tract the order, it is in Chinese which I don’t understand nor I speak this language. I just want to know what are my expectations about this order because this is taking too long to reached to me which I already paid for it. What is your time frame to have this delivered to me.

 

Thanks.

qq,Brian Hull,brian.p.hull64@gmail.com,Re: Scooter,2019-01-15,"I was wondering if there is any update on my item as it is transportation.
If possible can I get a tracking number and know what shipping company has
it? I appreciate the update as it is in transportation but would like to
know how much longer going on 2 months now since my order.  I held off with
the Attorney General because you said in transportation just look for more
information.

qq,Michel Ostiguy,michel.ostiguy@hotmail.ca,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-13,"Hello,

Following my numerous e-mails, I decided to communicate myself with Canada Post regarding the delivery of the LM229658721CN order. They say the delivery took place November 28, 2018, but I did not receive it at home.

I wanted to know why, and they told me that it had to be the sender who should open a request regarding the delivery of this package, that they can not tell me what it's all about.

So here is the phone number to join them
1-800-267-1177
According to them, it is your responsibility to ensure that the parcel is delivered to the buyer, so you have to make the move.

If you do not want to do this, two solutions would be possible, a full refund of the order on my credit card or a second delivery of the item in question.

I am getting impatient to see this package arrive and I would like to be able to give you a positive appreciation on Facebook, where I let myself be tempted by your product.

A response from you regarding your intention in this situation would be greatly appreciated.

thank you and with pleasure

Dear friend

   Thanks for your interesting,
   We ship directly from the factory,and because there has so many order need to pick and pack,so we have not start to delivery ,but the tracking number has been give  to you, we'll speed up the delivery of the package to your home as soon as possible.
   This is your tracking number:XM9J87450330
 And you can check it from this link:https://www.trackingmore.com/cn.html<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trackingmore.com%2Fcn.html&data=02%7C01%7C%7C999e33a73c5641ed89a408d65f3b403b%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636801105412125902&sdata=8KIiQ98U9ud6FxFqTd2dRDDTtA7XnfZu5qFDBZMh0F8%3D&reserved=0>
   This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our fulfillment center to the destination. International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.
*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.
   If the logistics status has not been shown$B!$(Bwe are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait$B!$(Bthanks for your  patience
   Best regards

After your supposed shipment in date of 2018-11-14 for order #1756, we
still have not received any product nor information from your company.
Although you seem to be based in England, your product has been shipped
from China with a Chinese transporter, so we can only guess our product is
still in transit.

We ask now for the refund of our order ($299.00 USD) within 8 days. After
this deadline, a complaint will be filed with the French authorities (Fraud
service of interior's Ministry).

Waiting for your answer,
Best regards,

 Dear friend

   Thanks for your interesting,
   We ship directly from the factory,and because there has so many order need to pick and pack,so we have not start to delivery ,but the tracking number has been give  to you, we'll speed up the delivery of the package to your home as soon as possible.
   This is your tracking number: XM9J87308244
   And you can check it from this link:https://www.trackingmore.com/cn.html
   This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our fulfillment center to the destination. International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.
*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.
   If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your  patience
   Best regards

I USED THE TRACKING INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED AND HERE IS WHAT I FOUND OUT -


  1.  The 1st link, trackingmore.com couldn't find any info about the order.

  2.  track.yw56.com said that the order was delivered at the mailbox on Nov. 29th.  I live in an apartment building and nothing has been delivered to my mailbox which is only the size for letters.
So this needs to be investigated from your end as I have no idea how to do that.  Below is the screenshot with the message.  The delivery service needs to call me to get into the building if the front door to the building is not open.  It is only open during normal business hours.  The package must be delivered to my door.  Please call 317-490-2205 so that I know that they are trying to deliver it. If you cannot deliver the item I purchased please give me a refund.

  3.  No. 2 above did not have any information about the tracking number.

  4.  No. 3 above did not have any information about the tracking number.

THANK YOU.

qq,Mary Washington-Hearn,elizabeth5360@hotmail.com,Re: Re:Order #3762,2019-01-09,"@2ufuture<mailto:support@2ufuture.com>: I wrote you an email yesterday responding to your email stating our merchandise was sent to us and I responded letting you know we have not received it.  I suspect it was delivered to the wrong address.  Someone needs to get in touch with me asap.  This is worrying me because now someone else has our merchandise.  If I do not hear from you all (I will check my email periodically the next 2 days) I will contact the bank and stop payment.  This has been horrifying for me and my husband and we have already been burned once ordering a product on line and they never sent it and they will not give me back my money.  Please don't do this to us. Thank you.

Hello.

Can we go back to the very beginning of this case.  The tracking shows that the item was delivered, so how can the courier arrive soon?

An item was delivered – it was not the shovel that I purchased, but a little hand-held squeegee (I included the picture of what I received).

I am hoping that you are a good and legitimate company and will either send me the correct product or refund my full amount.

Otherwise, I will need to find other avenues to collect my product and/or refund.

Thanks.

I’m starting to get concerned about the legitimacy of this order.  You have replied to the same email (well, I reforwarded asking for an update) with 2 different tracking numbers.  That makes it hard to believe that there is anything on the way,

I hope that your organization is real.  I have ordered a few things that have arrived but have stopped ordering anything new at this point because of the items that haven’t arrived. If the experience is good from here on out, I am sure I will be ordering in the future as well.

Hope this can be remedied soon.

Hello Support team.

I haven’t heard from you yet about the error in the product delivered.

Can you please advise on my next steps to ideally get the electric shovel ($69.99USD) vs the $5 handle I received.  If it is not possible to make a correction in product, please make sure that my money is refunded appropriately.

I am disappointed to say that the “shovel” showed up today and looks like the attached image (this is a window scraper).

International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.   If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your  patience   Best regards  ------------------ Original ------------------From:  ""Vince Rizzo""<casino5629@aol.com>;Date:  Sat, Dec 8, 2018 05:23 PMTo:  ""support""<support@2ufuture.com>; Subject:  My order Please tell me when my order will be delivered.

Since I have no answer from you, I’m asking you officially to proceed to full refund without delays.

Without any answer from you within this week, I’ll ask Visa to cancel the order and apply on you all fees that occured.

Dear Steve Kaziyev



I regret learning of the inconvenience you have experienced.



The Postal Service is aware of the frustration and disappointment caused when we do not live up to our commitment of safe and reliable mail service.



Upon investigation this package was delivered on 12/6/2018, and left with front desk/ reception.  If this package still can not be found, you can contact the sender and provide them with case ID# CA141216419, and have them start a lost item claim.



An apology is no substitute for good service, but I want to offer one on behalf of the Postal Service. We appreciate your reporting this matter to us. It helps to know the kinds of difficulties our customers have so we can work toward improvements. The information you have provided will be shared with management as they continue their efforts to improve service performance in your area.

This is just another way of putting off what you have scammed everyone 
out of the product they ordered. I have already contacted the services 
that I need to contact to make sure you don't get away with this again. 
People work hard for their money why don't you try doing the same 
instead of scamming people.
Stop with your bullshit!!!

This better be legit, because I will contact the FBI. My order better be 
exactly what I paid for or I will contact the federal authorities. This 
is not an idle threat - tired of people trying to scam good people. So 
my order better arrive soon.

Dear friend
 
   Thanks for your interesting,
   We ship directly from the factory,and because there has so many order need to pick and pack,so we have not start to delivery ,but the tracking number has been give  to you, we'll speed up the delivery of the package to your home as soon as possible.
   This is your tracking number:RF585662814SG
   And you can check it from this link:https://www.trackingmore.com/cn.html
   This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our fulfillment center to the destination. International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.
*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.
   If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your  patience

International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.   If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your  patience   Best regards  ------------------ Original ------------------From:  ""rhea domingo""<rheadomingo282@yahoo.com>;Date:  Thu, Dec 6, 2018 11:28 PMTo:  ""2ufuture""<support@2ufuture.com>; Subject:  Re: A shipment from order #1532 is on the way When do you deliver?

front door is usually closed. So since I do not usually provide a buzzer
number, the shipments usually get dropped at the nearest post office. Are
you able to check if that is what happened. And if so, which post office? I
already checked the nearest Canada Post and they don’t have it.

Besides, even if they were able to get in, the snow shovel would probably
not fit inside my mailbox. So it would be great if you could let me know.

Thank you,

Please confirm that this should have been a battery operated  compact snowblower for $99.  If you are talking about the little hand help ice scraper I received from someone in the mail as opposed to what I ordered then I will  have my attorney take up this matter with you from here forward.

To Whom It May Concern:

I have not gotten a response from anyone regarding my order.  There maybe some kind of mix-up because I have 2 order numbers.  The 1st time I ordered I did not go through with it but I received this order # 1864.  The reason I think is because I was checking to see if I needed to order 2 but when I went back in it made me order a second one plus I was trying to make sure the order was going to the correct address and not the PO Box # 12594 Hamtramck, MI. which is not our physical address but our billing address due to fraud.  I did go back and re-ordered the Snow Joe and my new order # is 3762.  Your company received their payment from our account on November 15, 2018.  To date I have inquired about this order and now I am getting the run around because the same message pops up about someone will contact me and no one has via e-mail or telephone.  Please let me know if and when I will receive the Snow Joe as We are concerned that we have been a victim of fraud again. That this company does not plan to give me my product or repay me.

Thank you.

Mary and James Hearn

It was not delivered. The ""tracking information"" you sent that says it was
delivered in November doesn't have a street address. It's January and
someone is finally answering my emails. I'd contact your company but your
website,which was attached to the one email sent to me, is non existent. I
don't want the excuses or a longer, drawn out wait for another product.
Just a refund. Thank you

that this is probably a scam - if a deal sounds almost too good to be true
it probably isn't true.

I suppose it is too much to ask if it is ever going to arrive.

   We ship directly from the factory,and because there has so many order need to pick and pack,so we have not start to delivery ,but the tracking number has been give  to you, we'll speed up the delivery of the package to your home as soon as possible.

   This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our fulfillment center to the destination. International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.
*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.

Hello

I am worried about your warranty.

I haven’t even received the shovels and the warranty is almost over.

It has been a month since I ordered the shovels.

Your ad assured that the product would be delivered promptly.

When can I expect it - I would like a date.

The tracking number and page leads to an Asian Facebook page. I am beginning to think that you are not a legitimate site.

If I don’t hear from you and receive my shovels this week, I will be forced to take this to the next step.

First, HAPPY NEW YEAR to the team! 
I am looking forward to getting my robot plow. When I ordered it, I remember the video showing a cart that can be attached to it and a change of shovels so the robot can be used for other work around the property in the spring and summer. I am interested in getting these other options as well. Can you please send me an e-brochure with the information (including the pricing) on these options? Thank you.
Best,
Damon

qq,Mary Washington-Hearn,elizabeth5360@hotmail.com,Re: Re:My order,2019-01-01,"To Whom It May Concern:

I have not gotten a response from anyone regarding my order.  There maybe some kind of mix-up because I have 2 order numbers.  The 1st time I ordered I did not go through with it but I received this order # 1864.  The reason I think is because I was checking to see if I needed to order 2 but when I went back in it made me order a second one plus I was trying to make sure the order was going to the correct address and not the PO Box # 12594 Hamtramck, MI. which is not our physical address but our billing address due to fraud.  I did go back and re-ordered the Snow Joe and my new order # is 3762.  Your company received their payment from our account on November 15, 2018.  To date I have inquired about this order and now I am getting the run around because the same message pops up about someone will contact me and no one has via e-mail or telephone.  Please let me know if and when I will receive the Snow Joe as We are concerned that we have been a victim of fraud again. That this company does not plan to give me my product or repay me.

Thank you.

Hallo.

Ich habe jetzt mehrfach nachgefragt wo meine Ware bleibt.

Anhand der Sendungsverfolgungsnummer habe ich rausgefunden das das Paket bereits ausgeliefert wurde, aber bei mir ist nichts angekommen!

Auch wurde mir beim ""Zusteller"" gesagt, das es sich bei der Sendung lediglich um einen Brief handeln soll......

Ich bitte sie hiermit ein letztes mal, mich über den Lieferzustand meiner bestellten Maschine zu informieren.


MfG

Dear friend


   Thanks for your interesting,

   We ship directly from the factory,and because there has so many order need to pick and pack,so we have not start to delivery ,but the tracking number has been give  to you, we'll speed up the delivery of the package to your home as soon as possible.

   This is your tracking number:

XM9J87398349

   And you can check it from this link:https://www.trackingmore.com/cn.html

   This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our fulfillment center to the destination. International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.

*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.

   If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your  patience

   Best regards

whereabouts!! There is no delivery address on the tracking. Your website

exists and your page doesn't either. I don't want another one,i want a
refund. This isn't a 9.99 trinket that got lost in the mail. It was
a $99 piece of equipment! Unacceptable

 Dear friend
   Thanks for your interesting,   We ship from the factory on our side,and because there has so many order need to pick and pack,so we have not start to delivery ,but the tracking number has been give  to you, we'll speed up the delivery of the package to your home as soon as possible.   This is your tracking number:UE686149113YP   And you can check it from this link:https://www.trackingmore.com/cn.html   If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing, we have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-14 days, please wait，thanks for your patient
  This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our fulfillment center to the destination. International delivery usually takes about 7-15 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 20 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.*Please note that these are estimated delivery times only, therefore there is not guaranteeing delivery dates.   Best regards  ------------------ Original ------------------From:  ""Dewayne Chamness""<dewaynechamness@yahoo.com>;Date:  Mon, Nov 12, 2018 12:14 PMTo:  ""2ufuture""<support@2ufuture.com>; Subject:  Re: Order #6826 confirmed I see this order is paid for please let me know when ships
