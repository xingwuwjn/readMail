I ordered 2 E bikes from you through your advertisement on Facebook in the USA. You stated these E-bikes were easy to fold as well as reliable and hit good top speeds, and could beat weight up to 230 lb. You stated the price was reduced from $699 to $199.99 per bike on November 23, 2018. 

Therefore, I ordered 2(two) of these advertised e-bikes, and was billed $399.98 through SUPREME Q LONDON Company on that same date. Your receipt to me did not have an authorization number nor did I receive a confirming email as is the case with most reputable companies. However, I have photos of the online transaction.

As of this date, January 9, 2019 I have not received my merchandise which was promised to be delivered in less than 30 days at the time of the transaction.
That would have made it in time for Christmas which has obviously come and gone.

I would like to know where my merchandise is, if you intend to deliver it or not. If it is not going to be delivered in the next 7 days, I am requesting a full refund of the monies of US dollars 399.98 be delivered back into the account.

Please reply to this e- mail within 24 hours so that I do not have to take any further action against your company.

Regards,

Hello, It has been over a month since I placed an order that never arrived nor did I receive a confirmation number or anything of that nature for a smart coffee table that was order and paid for. I have the bank statement where it shows you took my money and I have yet to receive my item. I don’t want to hear you need invoice number or confirmation number because it was never sent to me. I have proof from my bank account that you basically stole my money and if it is not returned ASAP I will go to court and have them take the money out of your account and then some for being scammers. I hope you find my order that was to be shipped to 12231 sawgrass reserve blvd Orlando Fl 32824 and my phone number is 3216966647. Email andrewlj00@gmail.com.. Idk what else you need but please look for my information on your system and refund me ASAP.

We bought this ladder in October  to use on our new RV .
It broke the first time we used it in November when we got our RV in Fl.  I climbed up to check the top of the RV. I weigh 128 lbs. I came down and we started to close it up and saw the it was broken. 
My husband wrote a letter but never received a response. No response . The warranty may have run out but it hadn’t been used until Thanksgiving . It seems like a great product but construction was defective or poor! 
So, we wasted $100!

qq,Toni Limoges,seamesmile4u@yahoo.com,Received wrong item!!,2018-12-24,"HORRIBLE COMPANY PEOPLE::

I purchased an inflatable spa on 12/06/18, order #30746, for $129. Today I received a child’s inflatable swimming pool that I can’t even fit in!  

I want my money credited back to my account NOW!!

You are pathetic and horrible for scamming your customers.  I have been trying to reach your company since the day after I ordered my spa and I have NEVER received an answer. This is uncalled for as a business! I needed this item as a Christmas gift and now I do t have a gift and I’m out $129. 

You are going to be reported as an unfair and scamming business. 
Put my money back on my card today!!!

Unfortunately,  the ones I 'fell for' weren't even in that category.  They were just items I hadn't really seen elsewhere, and that I would like to have. Your item is one I would like to have also. My mobility has taken a drastic turn this past year, and this scooter would allow me much more freedom.  But I just dont trust you. Convince me you are legit. Otherwise,  I will do everything I can to find out if you are a scam. And if you are...? I will be a very loud, very annoying thorn in your side. If you are a scam, my advice is to get out Now. The other scooter company ads are currently being bombarded, and lawsuits will Hopefully be following shortly.

Good Morning, 

We'd like to inform you a very important issue regarding your website, which
is the reason why you are losing lots of traffic. 

Your website is great in terms of design and content. However, it doesn't
follow Search Engine Guidelines. So, it has a very low visibility in search
results. 

We've done a thorough SEO audit of your website and found that it has a big
potential to generate more revenue than what it might be earning at the
present. And yes, we have generated a report for the same as well. 

We'd be glad to share the SEO audit report with you so that you can check it
yourself and find out what should be done to make it SEO friendly. 

Please reply to this email and one of our consultants will share the report.

I have just received two solar panels advertised on Facebook as 100 watt,

dimensions listed in the advertisement are 41.3 x 21.2 inches. The panels I
received are the wrong ones, as they are much smaller. The documentation
that came in the package states that they are 100 w. This is clearly
incorrect. Please advise me as to how you will rectify this mistake.
Attached please find photos showing the panels, the original packing
material.  I will be happy to send these back to you if you can assure me
that you can send me the correct panels. Of you cannot send me the correct
panels, then I would like a refund.

I received the panels, however they produce only 6.3V in direct sunlight. Besides this the product I received does not match the specification, nor it does match the picture from your website. Your website specifies  Size: 41.3 X 21.2 X 1 inch with 4 holes for mounting and attached wires. The product I receive is much smaller, does not have any holes and no wires.

 

I am afraid you sent me a wrong product.

qq,Michael Pitner,mspitner@msn.com,Return and refund request,2018-11-17,"Good Afternoon,

I was contact today by PayPal customer service concerning a dispute I made about the product I received. The product you shipped was not what I ordered. PayPal let me know that you would like pictures of what was received and what was ordered and that you would agree to take it back an issue a refund. They show that you were notified and agreed to the return and refund within the 14 days per your company requirements. Please issue a return goods authorization number if needed and a shipping address and I will get these back to you.

My Order number is #1186 was for two 100w 12v Monocrystalline semi flexible solar panels with controller/chargers. Approximate size 41.5 inch by 22.5 inches. See the pictures of what was ordered and what was delivered. The items delivered were single cell non-flexible units approximately 6"" by 9"" in size.

My construction company was hoping you might be a future source for our solar projects. Unfortunately after reading all of the negative reviews by customers on this product form your company it seems we can not do further business.

Sincerely

Michael Pitner

I sent this to you a week ago but you haven’t responded so I’m re-sending it today and hope you will respond.

I still haven’t heard from anybody regarding the fact that you shipped me the wrong solar panel on order #1695.

You sent a 20 watt panel instead of the 100 watt panel that I ordered and paid for.

Please advise.

I am super upset. I placed an order for the mini treadmill over a week ago and have yet to receive any email confirmation that my order was received yet my bank has informed me that the monies were received the next day. I ordered the item using the guest option if I am not receiving anything refund my money immediately. I have tried calling the phone number listed and funny it’s not a working number. The countless reviews that I have read stated that you are a scam business too bad for me as I only read the reviews after I placed the order.  There is no option for 24 hour chat and my other emails that I have sent to support@renn1ssance.com have not been responded to either. The name on the order is the same as the email address. Update me immediately or refund my money

Good afternoon,

I have received the subject order, however it is not the product I ordered
online. I have attached photos to show you the parcel I received and the
size of the actual product which measures 225mm x 133mm. There is no
regulator / charger and the panel sent is only 5w. Can you please rectify
the order to provide the actual product ordered, or provide a refund to my
credit card.

Kind regards,

qq,Harold Bieber,biebscope3@aol.com,Mistake! Shipping the wrong product!,2018-11-06,"

Sent from my iPad
Hello.  On Oct 3, 2018, I ordered the 100W 12V monocrystalline semi flexible solar panel for $79.99 using Paypal to make the payment.  I also paid $5.00 extra for express shipping. The order # is 1138 and the Paypal transaction ID is c5358123450441.1.  What arrived at my house on Oct 29th was not what I ordered and paid for!  It was a small panel with the letters YSC-MP5550 and the size was 225 x 133 mm. I'd appreciate it if you would correct this mistake  by sending what I ordered!
   The address to send the right solar panel is Harold Bieber, 135 Brookdale Rd., Salem, New Hampshire, 03079, USA.
   Thanks in advance for your correcting this error!  You appear to be a company that values the customer so I would not want to give negative feedback both with Paypal and social media.

qq,Petro,pjonker90@gmail.com,Re: Order #1662 confirmed,2018-11-05,"Hi,

I have received a order of solar panels but not correct.
The size I received is 420 mm x 280 mm.
This is not the size advertised which is 1050 mm x 540 mm.
The Specification shows 100 w which is not possible for the panels received which are half the size of those advertised and which I ordered as per advertisement.

Please respond.

Petro Jonker.

today a solar panel was delivered. However, it is not the sold 100W module, but only a 20W module, which has also been delivered without a charger. I ask for delivery of the correct panel and will return the delivered panel after notification of the return address. A partial repayment makes no sense to me.

qq,Christian von Bennigsen,cvbm@live.se,Where is my order you promised to deliver within 3-7 days?,2018-11-03,"Hi there,

I am very dissappointed with your way to handle your shipments.
When placing my order in october the 4th, I upgraded my order to 3-7 business days AND PAID FOR THAT PRIORITY TREATMENT!
I am still waiting for the delivery.
Even if - as I saw - the package is in Luxembourg right now and you might not be able to speed up the delivery process from where ever you are I really feel cheated by you. How can you promise extra short delivery time and take money for a promise you cannot keep?

I expect a very good explanation from you.
The least you should do is to pay back for the delivery upgrade.

I really hope that the goods I purchased is better than the way you sell your stuff.

With sad regards,

Christian von Bennigsen

Hello xiaoxinxin,

as previously reported did you send me the wrong item! Instead of the 100W solar panel you have sent me a tiny 20W version!
I can clearly see, that this is part of your business model, to cheat customers.

I will return the little 20W solar panel and expect a full refund within 24hours!
If I do not get the money within that period I will report you to paypal, so no further paypal transactions can be done by your store. And I also will report your store to the Chinese government for degrading the Chinese marketplace!

qq,Jeremy Davey,jez.davey@gmail.com,Re: Order #1192 confirmed,2018-10-30,"Good afternoon,

I have received the subject order, however it is not the product I ordered
online. I have attached photos to show you the parcel I received and the
size of the actual product which measures 225mm x 133mm. There is no
regulator / charger and the panel sent is only 5w. Can you please rectify
the order to provide the actual product ordered, or provide a refund to my
credit card.

Kind regards,

Jeremy Davey

eCommerce Profit Parasites Leech Revenues and Mislead Results https://www.prweb.com/releases/ecommerce_profit_parasites_leech_revenues_and_mislead_results/prweb15865365.htm

62% of merchants cite chargebacks as top benchmark for fraud, but many overlook their impact on revenue. Writing off chargebacks, returns, refunds and other losses as a cost of doing business can be very misleading, essentially resulting in ‘fake’ revenue that creates a false sense of security. Loss prevention specialist Chargebacks911 examines how profit parasites skew financial results and threaten eCommerce sustainability. Read the full article here https://www.prweb.com/releases/ecommerce_profit_parasites_leech_revenues_and_mislead_results/prweb15865365.htm

The item I received does not match what I ordered.  The one I ordered should come with 4 portable charging packs but I only got 3!  Also, I ordered the adaptors for iphone but I only got 1 iphone adaptor and the other 2 are useless to me.  

Either you send me the other portable charging pack so that I will get 4 as I ordered and also extra iphone adaptors, or I will demand a refund. 

Thank you for your attention.

qq,Junegie Hong,junegie.hong@gmail.com,This is a scam!!!,2018-10-24,"Neostylish,

I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with your delivered product.

I ordered 100 Watt flexible Sunpower solar panel but what i received is a 6
or 7 Watt plastic encapsulated solar panel which may worth about 10 USD $.
(See the enclosed photo).

I consider this is a definite scam!

If you don't reimburse or send a correct 100 watt Sunpower solar panel
(seen on the notebook screen in the photo) immediately, i will do something
against your company with our laywer.

Hello, good afternoon,

I bought recently a 100W 12V Monocrystalline Semi Flexible Efficiency Solar Panel Charger  1. But I received an item totally different that I had bought.
The item is smaller (see on the picture below) than I have bought on the website.
I am sending the pictures about the product tha I received and another picture about the product that I bought on the webside. So, If possibel, I would like some answer about this problem and how we can resolve it.

Thanks,

Fabio.

Items in this shipment
100W 12V Monocrystalline Semi Flexible Efficiency Solar Panel Charger × 1
My order for the above item has not arrived, however I have received this
from China:
Part ref: YSC-MP5550 - 225X133 - R104-0001 (242mm x 150mm). Believing this
delivery to be my original order I paid the import tax due, only to find
this unexpected part instead, which is certainly not the product described
above.

. Please advise me as to how, and how quickly, this mistake can be
rectified with no further expense to myself incurred. I would expect my
original order to be expedited to me as a priority and with taxes paid. Or,
if this is not possible, an immediate refund of my order with £15.60 for
tax expenses incurred receiving the wrong product. I await your prompt
response.

As I read in your site that you offer COD for hassle free and safe shipment. However, upon checking out there’s no COD in the option.. only paypal and debit/credit.
Please let me knoe if you are truly offering COD because that’s what you put in the site.
Thanks!

qq,Ed Molinar,edmolinarjr@gmail.com,My order,2018-10-17,"I’m curious about my order. On 10/4/18 I ordered 4 semi flex solar panels. I have a PayPal receipt (14658065FM404552A), but nothing from you guys. I received a shipping notice from DHL (6885276580) for a delivery scheduled for a product from Singapore.  The package specified is 1 at 6 lbs. Are all 4 solar panels in 1 package weighing only 6 lbs?

It is nothing like what u are advertising! 
I feel I have been ripped off for this so called solar panel witch is 
Only 225 mm x 133 mm 
The one in the ad u are showing 
Is 6 to 8 times bigger then what u sent me ! 
So how do we fix this problem 
I want the product that was advertised or a refund please !
Or I will report u to PayPal!

qq,KW,coolmaster4552@gmail.com,Re: Order #1309 confirmed,2018-10-17,"Off  course I received  the product or  else why the picture  and   did
your system  not say  so  via DHL.
I paid  by Credit card that should be reflected in  your system.
What  is happening to your system. ?
Please get  the  supplier to refund  my money and  I'll  return the item
at  your cost.
Is there something wrong you don't see the picture of the parts .
Is ridiculous  that  I have to provide you the information  that you should
have  and  where  is my receipt for payment ?



Thanks
Jerry

You sent me this email confirming my order and gave me a tracking number which doesn't work.  You received the funds,  which i confirmed with my bank, yet i still have not received my order or ANYTHING legitimate showing the order is shipping or being processed. 
I will give you 2 days to respond to this email then i shall take action.

qq,Loox Team,team@loox.io,The new way to boost sales - The Loox Popup,2018-10-15,"We just launched the new way to build strong trust with social proof that looks great

https://loox.io/app/nl_Popup

https://loox.io/app/nl_Popup

Hey,

Today we announce the launch of a new way to build strong trust with social proof that looks great - The Loox Popup!

When customers see that the product they are interested in is loved by others, they are much more likely to take action and make a purchase. As your customers browse through your store, The Loox Popup prominently displays reviews that are relevant to the specific page they are on.

https://loox.io/app/nl_Popup

Why Loox Popup

Context-aware

The Loox Popup only displays reviews that are relevant to the current page being viewed, maximizing click-through rates and conversions

On a product page - display reviews that are related to the product 
	On the cart page - display reviews related to items in the cart
	On other pages -  display high-rating reviews of all your products 

Highly Customizable 

Position - Choose which corner you’d like to have the Popup appear in 
	Rating - Define a minimum rating of reviews to display. You can only show 5-star reviews, if you’d like! 
	Duration - Configure the Popup display time, and the delay between Popups 
	Mobile - You can turn off the Loox Popup on mobile, if you wish

​The Loox Popup Widget combines the power of social proof, context awareness, relevance and a strong call to action; the perfect recipe to skyrocket your conversions.

Give it a try! The Loox Popup is available for free on all Loox plans.

Activate The Loox Popup https://loox.io/admin/track?NL_popup

Please contact us if you have any questions or run into any difficulties!

Cheers,

I am interested in your 100W 12V semi flex solar panels.
I am a caravan manufacturer in NSW Australia.
Is the price $79.99 in AU$ as the price doesn't change when I select other
currencies?
Is the price $79.99 available for a long time?
Do you have a phone number?
Does your solar panels come with a warranty?
How can I claim warranty if I have an issue?
Can you manufacture custom sizes?
Is the 20 day free shipping direct to my door?
