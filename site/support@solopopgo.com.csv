this whole order and I would like to get my money back. This is ridiculous
and I am not happy at all with the way, how you treat your customer. I have

search both the item I received (wireless ear buds) or the item I paid for
(walking pad treadmill) and neither are listed.  The website only shows
clothing.  I am still looking for answers as to why I was sent wireless ear
bud headphones instead of the walking pad treadmill that I paid for.  I am
not going to pay for shipping to return an incorrect item, and would like
to know when I can expect my refund, or treadmill to be sent to me.  I was
willing to be patient at first due to the holiday season and postal strike
here in Canada, but this has been going on for far too long.  I will gladly
return the unopened wireless earbud headphones, providing that your company
pays for shipping, but I would expect to receive either the treadmill that
I paid for, or a full refund.

I would like a refund for the total amount I was charged for the treadmill I never received immediately.  You had no problem taking my money immediately so I would like it refunded now.  This was ordered in November and I have been patient long enough.

You keep sending me the same response every time I contact you, which is an extremely incompetent policy.

I will be sure to never order from your company again and will be sure to inform everyone I know what a dishonest company you are.

Refund my money!

Hi Amy,

Please quit sending me a tracking link.  I have looked at the tracking and it says it was delivered on 12/17/18.

I am getting really frustrated because I don’t think you are even reading what I am writing.

I did not receive my Treadmill.  I repeat, I did not receive my Treadmill.

Either refund my money or send me my Treadmill.

This shouldn’t be this difficult.  So far, your service has been extremely poor and I am unhappy with your company.

I don’t think you understood me.  I was able to check the tracking.  It shows my treadmill was supposedly delivered on 12-17-18, but I never received it.

It shows the delivery to zip code 89501 but doesn’t show what the address it was delivered too.

I have been waiting for almost 2 months to get this and would really like to receive it.

Please check into this for me.

qq,Gayle MacBride,gaallyn@gmail.com,Re: AutoReply: Re: Order Notification,2019-01-17,"Order 2231

I have written several emails to you regarding Order 2231 that I placed and
Solopopgo confirmed on Tuesday, November 6, 2018 at 11:23 PM.  The tracking
number you sent is not a number that can be tracked via United States
Postal Service (USPS) in spite of the tracking information it gives.  I
personally went to our local office and asked them to track the number you
referenced, UE685135308YP.  It is not in USPS system. If it cannot be
tracked in the USPS system, then it is a false number and the tracking
information given is false too.  If the post office would have delivered it
to me, or held it at the post office in Crown Point, as your tracking
information says, they would have a record of it.  Again, the tracking
number you supplied is incorrect and the tracking information attached to
that number is also false.   Basically, this looks and smells like a scam.
You have taken my $139.99 USD; you have not delivered the product ordered,
and you have supplied false information as to the shipping and delivery of
the product.  The order was never delivered to me or to the post office
here.   I expect a refund of 139.99 United States Dollars.  Your company,
or companies, have not kept your part of the agreement, as agreed to in the
confirmation received from Solopopgo and furthermore the shipping
information you have supplied is false and deceptive.  I will appreciate
your quick response regarding the refund and the money returned to me via a
credit.  Please let me know when I can expect the refund.  I trust that you
did not intend to commit fraud and so will correct this situation by
refunding my payment of $139.99 USD.

As I mentioned in my previous email cancel my order and refund my money within the next 48hrs or I am going to the authorities this is a scam and is not proper transaction. 

 

Refund my money

Not Found:
Your tracking info was not found, Possible reasons:
1: The carrier hasn't accepted your package yet.
2: The carrier hasn't scanned and entered your package tracking information into their system yet.
3: Your tracking number is incorrect or invalid.
4: Your tracking number has expired and removed from carrier's system.

Thank you for your email, after all the other emails you have sent me this is a scam. You have already told me 3 times that my shipment has shipped and tracking has told me it has delivered and I haven`t received it. I do not want this shipment any longer, please do not ship I do not want to wait another 7-15 days for this shipment as I have waited 2 months already, please refund my money.

 

Below is what happens now when I type in my email address.  There is no reason why you cannot stop the shipment and process the refund. I will start an investigation on this through the authorities if you do not refund the money on my credit card.

 

If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your patience thank you

qq,Gene Welch,lutrabah@hotmail.com,Order #1779 cordless snow thrower,2019-01-17,"
2 months ago I ordered a cordless snowthrower and received  an order confirmation number 1779. My credit card was charged for the item I have heard nothing since then. I expect a response, a refund, or the snowthrower. There are actions that can be taken regardless of the countries involved.

Originally i ordered a walking pad.
Apparently the wrong item has been shipped as I'm informed by the Egyptian
customs office that there is a delivery for me that is not a walking pad.

What was shipped my way ?

Best,
Aya

I tried that link, and when I try to click submit it is not doing anything.  Again, I am not returning the product because I never received it.  I would just like to get the product resent to me, or if that is too much trouble, just refund me the money.
Thank you,Kim

Send the product. Or admit you are liars and thieves who stole money by false advertising of a product you don’t make. 

You will then pay treble damages (3 X what I paid).

This order did not arrive. Our office is very careful about receipt of any and all packages whether they are shipped via USPS, FedEX or UPS.
This order which has taken almost 2 months was supposedly delivered by USPS. On January 3rd.  There is no evidence it was delivered and there is no signature or return receipt here at the office.
What are you going to do about this?

I appreciate that these things take time. I also had every reason to believe my purchased paid for products were shipped, I would get an email stating so. I got no such advance notice. I waited and watched for delivery for weeks. These were supposed to be Christmas gifts! Ordered on 11/10/18 I was assured of delivery by then. I will wait awhile longer for your plans for a satisfactory fix for this little mess. I would LOVE to have the 2 treadmills! I was thrilled with the video and took a chance on a company I hadn't vetted. I'm sorry now. Thanking you in advance for your help,                       Laura Seiler

I would really love to have my 2 under desk folding treadmills but will settle for full refund. Awaiting your reply. Thank you for your help,

I ordered the product on 16 November 2018 and it has still not arrived. Well over a month and I'm still waiting. I am started to think that I am being scammed and I'm investigating the position. Unless I hear back from you with a positive comfirmation of when my purchase will arrive by return, I will be taking up this matter further and claiming a full refund. I trust this will not be necessary.

Thank you for the slightly condensing reply to my enquiry. Being referred to as 'dear' for simply requesting how long my order will take to arrive was not appreciated. Having seen your product advertised on Instagram I was excited about this product and was intending to gift this to my father for Christmas. I am assuming that it will not arrive before Christmas?

I understand that I need to be 'patient, but considering I ordered this item over a month ago I am sure you can understand my concerns of how long it will take to arrive.

It’s obvious the English must be your second language. No one has responded to any of my emails, have actually read them and understood the content. I did receive an item which I did not order. The package had no paperwork inside. Therefore I crossed the address label out and wrote return to sender, and dropped it in the mailbox. This item was a piece of crap. It was not $139 item that I ordered. Please have somebody that understands the English language better, read this and please re-send the item that I paid for.

Once again, you are not paying attention to the problem. I received an item that I did not order. Had no clue it had been sent in error instead of the treadmill. Therefore all I did was re-seal the envelope and write return to sender and put it in the mailbox. It wasn’t something I ordered so I returned it. I was not going to be responsible for shipping charges. Since there were absolutely no instructions inside of the envelope I had no other option. Please send me the item that I paid $139 for. If this does not occur I will be contacting my credit card company and asking them to withdraw a payment to you due to your non-compliance to resolve this matter.
This type of behavior on behalf of your company is unacceptable. I cannot believe the amount of time that I have wasted dealing with you. Immediate action as expected or I will be contacting my credit card company.
Sincerely,
Susan April

So, please send me the correct item that I ordered. I sent the wrong items back. However, I only wrote “return to sender” as there was NO paperwork inside the envelope, nor were there any instructions on how to use the earpieces.
I really want the item I ordered. If it’s not available please issue me a refund

Susan April

This is what I ordered for $139.99

<CFAC610B@DCC1B20C.12E72D5C<mailto:CFAC610B@DCC1B20C.12E72D5C>>

These are not a 139.99 product

Please resend the CORRECT product – folded fitness walker

Extremely big difference – 5in x 7 in package compared to something that should be at least 24 inches or more!

Please either credit my account the 139.99 or send what I ordered.
This is ridiculous!!!!!!!!

No such package arrived. I did receive from Korea some blutooth headphones that I never ordered. Is it possible that you shipped the wrong product. I am out of the country until late next week and my brother has been at my house and again no treadmill was delivered. could you please look into this matter.

purchase. I paid $140 USD for foldable fitness equipment, something not
even on your website anymore. This is clear fraud and I demand a refund
ASAP or I will get a charge back through my bank. This is unbelievable.

qq,Lisa@lisachernow.com,Lisa@lisachernow.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-09,"Do you realize that a company that makes a walking pad has a Facebook page on which many of the people Solopopgo has screwed over in exactly the same way it has me are posting about you? Angry customers complaining about this shoddy treatment and asking about legal action. People are HURT. 

Your note says I should be patient while you “deal my question.”

WHAT? You steal from and lie to me and others and have the audacity to ask for patience?  

All you are supposed to do is send the product for which I paid and your company sent false shipping information, which is a serious crime with hefty fines when committed on this scale. 

I want the product for which I paid. 

But it seems unlikely that the product is even exists.  It seems likely that Solopopgo is a scam.

A company that takes $140 from a number of customers and goes to the trouble of sending those customers a totally unrelated and utterly worthless product is run by people who are immoral, unethical, soulless and arrogant criminals, possibly very stupid criminals since the expense to ship trash cut your profits.

I am generally a forgiving person but this is outrageous.

Think about your personal role in perpetuating this evil. Have you no shame, no self-respect? I guess not.

I hope you and every person who is responsible for this scam suffer severe consequences. 

Your customer service is horrible.

I told you that I do not have to go anywhere to investigate, you are always sending me to enter a page, I do not have to investigate anything,
I just wait for my product or my refund.

send me the product you buy and pay
and finished business,
or you give me my refund
this is the last time I write you asking for my reimbursement or my product, the next one will be, go up to the page of the scammers, to alert the world of their false products
because that's what they have done with me, swindling me
you are fraudulent

I am already tired with that stupid, I need my product, this is a fraud on your part, so give me a refund, since they do not comply with the delivery of my purchase.

I do not have to go where you are sending me, I need my product or my refund.

You are responsible, to deliver the product you buy, or give me my refund.

but I will put an alert to the world, because you are thieves, you do fraud, you are not loyal people, you are not reliable, you are cheaters.

You know, do not send me to that site to investigate my purchase, that of investigating is up to you, not me.

I just want my product that I buy or my refund.

I wrote to them claiming, because those steps already cancel me from doing them, and says that the package
It was delivered and that is false, here in my house has never been that problem, I always receive what I buy.
and the product of you I have not received, so I demand my package or my money, or is this a fraud on your part ?.

you know, do not tell me to follow those steps
that with that nothing is resolved, I want my purchase.

qq,Maggie Adams,maggie.adams@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-08,"Hi-
To reiterate again, I DO NOT need information on tracking, as *the package
originally shipped to me DID NOT contain the item I ordered*.  I am happy
to return the item that was mistakenly shipped to me (wireless earbuds that
I did not order, do not want, and have not opened), but need you to provide
instructions on how to return them.  In the meantime, *I need the item that
I purchased to be shipped to me, as it has now been two months since I
ordered and paid for it, and I still have not received it.*
*If someone does not confirm that the folding treadmill I bought is on its
way to me, I will be forced to report you to my credit card company and to
Instagram for non-delivery and fraud*.  I do not want to do this, but I
will have no choice if someone does not immediately confirm that the
folding treadmill I purchased 2 months ago is being shipped to me.
Thank you,
Maggie

qq,Haroon Rasheed,hr8884@gmail.com,Re: Can you please call me,2019-01-08,"You guys keep sending me the same email. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT. THERE IS NO RECORD OF IT BEING SHIPPED. I have a bank statement showing I was charged 149.99 US dollars. And there is no record of the order. Here is the text I received from you. I have already sent you a copy with the email I received. THERE IS NO ORDER RECORD ON THE WEBSITE YOU KEEP SENDING ME TO! would you like this translated into Chinese Mandarin to understand my concern?

我在11月份向貴公司下了訂單。我有銀行對賬單，電話留言和電子郵件的記錄。但是，貴公司尚未發貨。我一直收到同樣的電子郵件，要求我查看跟踪購買的鏈接。我告訴你沒有我購買的記錄。我花了149.99美元買這個產品。你根本沒有發貨這個產品。請把產品發給我，或者告訴我它已經發貨的記錄。

I told you that I do not have to go anywhere to investigate, you are always sending me to enter a page, I do not have to investigate anything,
I just wait for my product or my refund.

send me the product you buy and pay
and finished business,
or you give me my refund
this is the last time I write you asking for my reimbursement or my product, the next one will be, go up to the page of the scammers, to alert the world of their false products
because that's what they have done with me, swindling me
you are fraudulent

I am already tired with that stupid, I need my product, this is a fraud on your part, so give me a refund, since they do not comply with the delivery of my purchase.

I do not have to go where you are sending me, I need my product or my refund.

You are responsible, to deliver the product you buy, or give me my refund.

but I will put an alert to the world, because you are thieves, you do fraud, you are not loyal people, you are not reliable, you are cheaters.

You know, do not send me to that site to investigate my purchase, that of investigating is up to you, not me.

I just want my product that I buy or my refund.

I wrote to them claiming, because those steps already cancel me from doing them, and says that the package
It was delivered and that is false, here in my house has never been that problem, I always receive what I buy.
and the product of you I have not received, so I demand my package or my money, or is this a fraud on your part ?.

you know, do not tell me to follow those steps
that with that nothing is resolved, I want my purchase.

I still haven’t received my order #9464
Like I said before in my email, I also cannot check the shipment status. No one is replying my email.

But this morning I just received health bracelet that I never order from Solopopgo? Is this a joke?
As you can see I am ordering urban electric vehicle, not a health bracelet.

qq,Lisa@lisachernow.com,Lisa@lisachernow.com,Re: AutoReply: Re: Order Notification,2019-01-08,"Are you people just flat out hateful and rude intentionally?

Can you not READ?

What was shipped to me was not what I ordered or even something anyone could use. Imitation AirPods worth less than $1. 

You were paid $139 for a fitness device — a walking pad / walking treadmill.

I tracked my package, it did no good because you didn’t send what I ordered, you sent me cheap garbage; nothing to do with fitness.

I sent you TWICE tonight proof that your company received payment.

Send me what I ordered, immediately and with rush charges at your expense. 

I was disappointed when I discovered today that others ordered the walking treadmill and got nothing but trashy fake AirPods. 

Now you have made me angry.

The credit card company will refund my money and your company will incur higher fees and a less favorable credit score.

And then I will do my level best to ensure that no one I know does business with you. 

There are enough people who have experienced this same issue with you to form a Class Action Lawsuit and I am prepared to move that process along.

I will file complaints with the Office of the Attorney General of Texas AND the Office of the Attorney General of the United States to begin legal action against you for consumer fraud and float the class action lawsuit. 

Don’t lie to me, don’t send me bullshit responses that prove you aren’t paying attention. 

Send the thing for which I paid or 

pay treble damages for the pain and suffering you inflicted upon me and the friend for whom that was to be a Christmas gift, or

be prepared for lengthy public relations nightmares and lawsuits. 

What a terrible customer service experience.

I gather you didn’t read my note. The walking pad, or walking treadmill, didn’t arrive. The company sent some cheap earbuds instead. Total scam.

Hello.

The signature on your tracking notice does not work for the company I work for.

The package was allegedly signed for by someone named “J. Alvas” from a company called The Real Real; www.therealreal.com<http://www.therealreal.com>.

So far, they have no information regarding my delivery.

USPS left the package in our building mailroom, but it never reached my office in Suite 1200.

I am contacting USPS to begin an investigation of theft.

I will let you know what happens.


Thank you,

Why is it taking so long?? Ridiculous.

Transit 41 days according to the link and arrived in Australia 28 November
2018

If it is not coming I demand a refund or at least a reply with a date that
I will have the item.Very poor customer service.

I told you that I do not have to go anywhere to investigate, you are always sending me to enter a page, I do not have to investigate anything,
I just wait for my product or my refund.

send me the product you buy and pay
and finished business,
or you give me my refund
this is the last time I write you asking for my reimbursement or my product, the next one will be, go up to the page of the scammers, to alert the world of their false products
because that's what they have done with me, swindling me
you are fraudulent

I am already tired with that stupid, I need my product, this is a fraud on your part, so give me a refund, since they do not comply with the delivery of my purchase.

I do not have to go where you are sending me, I need my product or my refund.

You are responsible, to deliver the product you buy, or give me my refund.

but I will put an alert to the world, because you are thieves, you do fraud, you are not loyal people, you are not reliable, you are cheaters.

You know, do not send me to that site to investigate my purchase, that of investigating is up to you, not me.

I just want my product that I buy or my refund.

I wrote to them claiming, because those steps already cancel me from doing them, and says that the package
It was delivered and that is false, here in my house has never been that problem, I always receive what I buy.
and the product of you I have not received, so I demand my package or my money, or is this a fraud on your part ?.

you know, do not tell me to follow those steps
that with that nothing is resolved, I want my purchase.

The signature on your tracking notice does not work for the company I work for.

The package was allegedly signed for by someone named “J. Alvas” from a company called The Real Real; www.therealreal.com<http://www.therealreal.com>.

So far, they have no information regarding my delivery.

USPS left the package in our building mailroom, but it never reached my office in Suite 1200.

I am contacting USPS to begin an investigation of theft.

I will let you know what happens.

J'ai essayé ce que vous me dites de faire avec le tracking, et ça mentionne: ""Not found"".
Pouvez-vous me dire pourquoi je n'ai pas encore reçu ma commande svp?
Je n'ai rien reçu, et votre lien de tracking ne m'indique rien.
C'est à vous de trouver la problématique, ou me l'envoyer, car je n'ai rien reçu, et ça fait presque 2 mois que j'ai passé ma commande.

I need to figure out what happened to the treadmill I ordered and did not receive. I paid you for it but I did not get it. I cannot ship it back for the refund because I do not have it.

Everyone is giving me the same information over and over but if you actually tried the tracking number that you give me you will see that it DOES NOT WORK. SEE SCREEN SHOT BELOW.

 

This is all false information and fraud. I want my refund back on my credit card like I said 48hrs ago. I have contacted the authorities and told them what is going on and they are starting an investigation. I would like you to cancel this order like I have said 5 times already and refund my money back on my credit card. 

 

My Order number is Order #5293, and I expect a refund for $139.99 USD back on my credit card.  If you cannot assist me please have someone that can message me back and provide my reference number for my refund.

 

I do not want another tracking email, I do not want another email telling me the package is on its way. I want my money back.

Please advise ASAP

Again thank you very much for your email but your still providing false information. I just tracked from your email again and it doesn’t provide me any information. It says tracking not found. As I mentioned in my previous email cancel my order and refund my money within the next 48hrs or I am going to the authorities this is a scam and is not proper transaction. 

 

Refund my money

Not Found:
Your tracking info was not found, Possible reasons:
1: The carrier hasn't accepted your package yet.
2: The carrier hasn't scanned and entered your package tracking information into their system yet.
3: Your tracking number is incorrect or invalid.
4: Your tracking number has expired and removed from carrier's system.

Thank you for your email, after all the other emails you have sent me this is a scam. You have already told me 3 times that my shipment has shipped and tracking has told me it has delivered and I haven`t received it. I do not want this shipment any longer, please do not ship I do not want to wait another 7-15 days for this shipment as I have waited 2 months already, please refund my money.

 

Below is what happens now when I type in my email address.  There is no reason why you cannot stop the shipment and process the refund. I will start an investigation on this through the authorities if you do not refund the money on my credit card.

 

If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your patience thank you

qq,Gayle MacBride,gaallyn@gmail.com,Re: AutoReply: Re: Order Notification,2019-01-07,"There is definitely a communication problem here.  Evidently you did not
read my last email.  The link you just sent is the one you sent before.  I
have looked at it.  This package was not delivered to my mail box nor was
it delivered to my house.  My mail box is large enough for letters, but a
60 pound package would could not be delivered there.  I took this tracking
information to the Crown Point Post Office.  They have no record of the
package coming in and they cannot locate the tracking number you gave in
their records.  So-- that package was NOT delivered to me.  Therefore I
will need a refund of $139.99 US dollars for the item I ordered, paid for
but have not received.  I'm also filing a claim with the United State Post
Office, so that they can attempt to track the item by the tracking number
you gave.  Please advise when I will receive the refund of $139.99 US
dollars for a product I did not receive.  I expect an honest response.

Gayle MacBride

Below is my previous email to you.  Please read it and respond
appropriately.
*I have just come from our local post office.  They tried to track the
shipment by the tracking number UE685135308YP on the tracking information I
got from clicking on the link www.oiele.com/tracking/express
<http://www.oiele.com/tracking/express>.  The post office could not pull up
this tracking number on their system. There is no evidence that the package
was ever delivered to this post office, USPS, in Crown Point, Indiana. It
appears that the tracking information connected to this tracking number is
in error or false.  I have not received the item I ordered, our post office
did not received it (in spite of the tracking information, which cannot be
verified).  I will be filing a claim with the USPS.  Furthermore, the
tracking information says I requested that the item be delivered to the
local post office.   I did not request that it be delivered to the post
office.  I requested it be delivered to my home address.  This has not
happened, and there is no record that the package was even delivered to the
local post office nor have you provided accurate information as to the
location of the package.  Since you have not been able to deliver the
package to my address, and the package cannot be located, I will need a
refund for $139.99, the amount paid for order 3341, 1 - folded fitness
equipment.  Again, the refund is because the equipment was never delivered
to me.  *

Please quit sending me a tracking link.  I have looked at the tracking and it says it was delivered on 12/17/18.

I am getting really frustrated because I don’t think you are even reading what I am writing.

I did not receive my Treadmill.  I repeat, I did not receive my Treadmill.

Either refund my money or send me my Treadmill.

I don’t think you understood me.  I was able to check the tracking.  It shows my treadmill was supposedly delivered on 12-17-18, but I never received it.

It shows the delivery to zip code 89501 but doesn’t show what the address it was delivered too.

I have been waiting for almost 2 months to get this and would really like to receive it.

Please check into this for me.

Thank you

Amy the treadmill never arrived. Again I have asked the usps driver if she delivered a treadmill and the answer is no. I have looked at your reviews online specifically for the treadmill purchases everyone has the same issue. You send this link that says it’s shipped and nothing comes. I want my money back or the treadmill.

You are not listening.  I have already clicked the link and tracked the package every time you email me.  I did NOT received the merchandise.  If you want me to release the credit card hold you must deliver the merchandise or cancel my order.  It is that simple.  Do not email me back again telling me to track the shipment.  Either email me stipulating you are resending the merchandise to the correct address or cancelling the order.  Those are the ONLY two options.

You are not listening or understanding.  I checked the link.  The link shows the packaged delivered, however it does NOT show the address it delivered too.  I did NOT RECEIVE the merchandise ordered.  There is nothing to return to your company.  I will not pay for merchandise I did not receive.  If you want to send a new package to the correct address, I will release the credit card to pay you for the merchandise. I will not release the credit card until the purchased item is RECEIVED at my home like I ordered.

qq,Luis Maria Moreno Barbero,mororgan@gmail.com,silla automatica conveertible,2019-01-07,"Let's see the day 08/11/2018 I made a payment of 134'28 euros for the price
of my order an automatic convertible chair in bed to get under cars for
repairs. At the beginning of December I receive a pack of you containing a
cell phone headset which I have never asked for. You confirm a traking
whose number is """" ""UE685839085YP"" """" and says delivered. Well this
tracking corresponds to a miniature headset for mobile phones as I say
before that I've never asked and I'm charged 134.28 euros for it. ..but the
automatic chair that is what I have paid does not arrive. So I think this
is a scam on your part, because they sell me those headphones that are
worth 30 euros at the price of 134.28 euros, which was what I paid for that
automatic chair that has never arrived. My claim is for that chair that I
have bought from you and has still sent it to me. Then, if within 15 days,
I have not received said chair, I will automatically file a complaint for
fraud in the internet crimes court. through my lawyer, against solopopgo.
com I hope you give me a correct answer to this matter, in avoidance of
worse evils, that is not beneficial to anyone.-I HOPE YOUR CORRECT AND SOON

I never received the item. Please refund my money. The tracking below says delivered back on 12/5 – the only item I received around that time was ear buds. I ordered a piece of exercise equipment – compact treadmill, not earbuds.

As I mentioned in my previous email cancel my order and refund my money within the next 48hrs or I am going to the authorities this is a scam and is not proper transaction. 

 

Refund my money

Not Found:
Your tracking info was not found, Possible reasons:
1: The carrier hasn't accepted your package yet.
2: The carrier hasn't scanned and entered your package tracking information into their system yet.
3: Your tracking number is incorrect or invalid.
4: Your tracking number has expired and removed from carrier's system.

Thank you for your email, after all the other emails you have sent me this is a scam. You have already told me 3 times that my shipment has shipped and tracking has told me it has delivered and I haven`t received it. I do not want this shipment any longer, please do not ship I do not want to wait another 7-15 days for this shipment as I have waited 2 months already, please refund my money.

 

Below is what happens now when I type in my email address.  There is no reason why you cannot stop the shipment and process the refund. I will start an investigation on this through the authorities if you do not refund the money on my credit card.

 

If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your patience thank you

I am already tired with that stupid, I need my product, this is a fraud on your part, so give me a refund, since they do not comply with the delivery of my purchase.

I do not have to go where you are sending me, I need my product or my refund.

You are responsible, to deliver the product you buy, or give me my refund.

but I will put an alert to the world, because you are thieves, you do fraud, you are not loyal people, you are not reliable, you are cheaters.

You know, do not send me to that site to investigate my purchase, that of investigating is up to you, not me.

I just want my product that I buy or my refund.

I wrote to them claiming, because those steps already cancel me from doing them, and says that the package
It was delivered and that is false, here in my house has never been that problem, I always receive what I buy.
and the product of you I have not received, so I demand my package or my money, or is this a fraud on your part ?.

you know, do not tell me to follow those steps
that with that nothing is resolved, I want my purchase.

It’s obvious the English must be your second language. No one has responded to any of my emails, have actually read them and understood the content. I did receive an item which I did not order. The package had no paperwork inside. Therefore I crossed the address label out and wrote return to sender, and dropped it in the mailbox. This item was a piece of crap. It was not $139 item that I ordered. Please have somebody that understands the English language better, read this and please re-send the item that I paid for.
Stop, I repeat stop sending these stupid useless responses

Once again, you are not paying attention to the problem. I received an item that I did not order. Had no clue it had been sent in error instead of the treadmill. Therefore all I did was re-seal the envelope and write return to sender and put it in the mailbox. It wasn’t something I ordered so I returned it. I was not going to be responsible for shipping charges. Since there were absolutely no instructions inside of the envelope I had no other option. Please send me the item that I paid $139 for. If this does not occur I will be contacting my credit card company and asking them to withdraw a payment to you due to your non-compliance to resolve this matter.
This type of behavior on behalf of your company is unacceptable. I cannot believe the amount of time that I have wasted dealing with you. Immediate action as expected or I will be contacting my credit card company.
Sincerely,
Susan April

This is the crap that I received, and sent back “return to sender”



<CFAC610B@DCC1B20C.12E72D5C>

These are not a 139.99 product

Please resend the CORRECT product – folded fitness walker

Extremely big difference – 5in x 7 in package compared to something that should be at least 24 inches or more!

Please either credit my account the 139.99 or send what I ordered.
This is ridiculous!!!!!!!!

Sehr geehrter Herr Wunsch,



vielen Dank für Ihre Geduld!



In solchen Fällen wäre dann unbedingt ein Nachforschungsauftrag in die Wege zu leiten, dies kann allerdings nur der Absender machen (wozu er in so einem Fall auch verpflichtet ist). Kontaktieren Sie daher bitte nochmal den Absender und weisen diesen daraufhin,
 dass er einen Nachforschungsauftrag über die Post in die Wege leiten muss.



Gerne sind wir auch in Zukunft zuverlässig für Sie da!

I dont need help tracking the package, I need someone to PLEASE SEND ME THE FOLDING TREADMILL I ORDERED. I still have not received the treadmill I purchased two months ago and need your help getting it shipped to me.
Is there a phone number I can call to speak to someone? I am not getting the help I need to fix this problem via email.

Yes, I did click on the link, and saw that it says the package was delivered.  Unfortunately, that is not true.  I did NOT receive the folding treadmill I ordered.  I think perhaps you shipped the wrong item, as I DID receive wireless earbuds around that time, which I didn't order and wasn't sure why they showed up or who sent them.  Please confirm that you will be shipping me the folding treadmill I ordered and paid for two months ago.  If you would like me to return the headphones, please let me know how to do that and I can handle it immediately.
Thanks,
Maggie

Hello-
It says the package was delivered on Dec 12, but that is not correct.  I did not receive a folding treadmill - which is the product I ordered.  I think maybe the wrong item was sent, as I did receive some wireless headphones around that time, but wasn't aware those came from you, because there was very little information in the package, and I couldn't tell who it was shipped from.  If you can confirm that you shipped me headphones by mistake, I am very happy to return them, as they are still unopened and unused, but I need to get an update on when my folding treadmill will be shipped.
Thanks for your help.

Thank you for your email.  Unfortunately, 3 of the 4 services did not recognize that tracking number, and the only service that worked (this one: http://track.yw56.com.cn/en-US/) says the delivery was completed 20 days ago, which is not accurate.  I definitely did not receive the folding treadmill I purchased, so would like to confirm that the tracking number is accurate and also that correct item was shipped.  If not, can you please ship a folding treadmill to me immediately?  I ordered this item on November 11, almost full two months ago at this point, so it's unacceptable that I still can't even get correct information about if/when it was shipped.  Please help!
Thank you,
Maggie

qq,Kemet Music,kemet3rdparty@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-06,"Hi thank you for responding, but the tracking say delivered on the 30th Nov
2018. However was not in the country at the time plus the person left on
premises has received no delivery. Plus speak to your shippers to find out
where they delivered to and who signed.

I paid for 3 days delivery and it wasn't delivered within even 14 days. I
expect either a full refund or the product to  be delivered.

qq,Bill5620@gmail.com,bill5620@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-05,"The package was not delivered.  AND it has taken you almost a month to
reply to my email request.  I have been asking about this package since the
last week of November and have even left messages on your international
phone number.  You tell me over two weeks after it was supposedly delivered
that it was delivered over two weeks prior.  This is unacceptable.  I now
have no way to try to determine what might have happened on my end.

Also, the tracking information that Solopopgo provided in the 'purchase
confirmed' gmail did not work and took me constently to a 404 error page,
which is why I initially tried to make contact with you.

As I said, I have been on active lookout for this package since just after
Thanksgiving.  It was not delivered.  I have reported this to my credit
card company.  Please refund my money or provide a new shipment, along with
accurate tracking information so that I can be prepared for its delivery.

ordered and paid on last November 11 of 2018.
These tracks that you sent did npt  show anything.  I am very up set, i
spent $139.00 dollars and did not received any notification of shipping
order. I think this is a fraude and will go to make further action because
this is a case of police and it is very disrespectful.

it was delivered to my mailbox. It is a large package which could not have
been put in my mailbox. It would have to have been put at my door. The USPS
does not leave packages at the door without signature.  Or it would have
been there without saying it was delivered to my mailbox!
Please correct this!!! Stop sending me the tracking information over and

qq,Gayle MacBride,gaallyn@gmail.com,Re: AutoReply: Re: Order Notification,2019-01-04,"I have just come from our local post office.  They tried to track the
shipment by the tracking number UE685135308YP on the tracking information I
got from clicking on the link www.oiele.com/tracking/express.  The post
office could not pull up this tracking number on their system. There is no
evidence that the package was ever delivered to this post office, USPS, in
Crown Point, Indiana. It appears that the tracking information connected to
this tracking number is in error or false.  I have not received the item I
ordered, our post office did not received it (in spite of the tracking
information, which cannot be verified).  I will be filing a claim with the
USPS.  Furthermore, the tracking information says I requested that the item
be delivered to the local post office.   I did not request that it be
delivered to the post office.  I requested it be delivered to my home
address.  This has not happened, and there is no record that the package
was even delivered to the local post office nor have you provided accurate
information as to the location of the package.  Since you have not been
able to deliver the package to my address, and the package cannot be
located, I will need a refund for $139.99, the amount paid for order 3341,
1 - folded fitness equipment.  Again, the refund is because the equipment
was never delivered to me.

qq,Diane Verdi Lukomski,dmverdi@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-04,"Hello. I do not think that you understand my issue, given the fact that you
re-sent the same tracking number that again illustrates that the incorrect
item was delivered to me. To refresh your memory, I have attached a copy of
the email of the item I ordered - Order #10498, which was a folding
treadmill for $139.99. I also attached photos of the item that I actually
received from you in the mail, which is the item that was delivered to me
via the tracking number you provided multiple times - a set of earbuds with
an indicated customs value of $5.00 on the shipping package. At this point
I would simply like a refund of the $139.99 that I paid for the treadmill
that I never received. I don't want the earbuds as I did not order them,
and I would be happy to send them back if solopopgo pays the return
shipping cost given that this was your error and not mine. I have already
opened up a dispute with my credit card company regarding this order
because you were previously unresponsive. Please advise.

delivered.  Unfortunately, that is not true.  I did NOT receive the folding
treadmill I ordered.  I think perhaps you shipped the wrong item, as I DID
receive wireless earbuds around that time, which I didn't order and wasn't
sure why they showed up or who sent them.  *Please confirm that you will be
shipping me the folding treadmill I ordered and paid for two months ago*.
If you would like me to return the headphones, please let me know how to do
that and I can handle it immediately.

qq,Kathy Rowan,kitkat.rowan@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-04,"Hello again,

I am following up - I check and the first email that I didn't even get
until the 26th of December to show my item had been shipped - but also
showed it was to have been delivered on the 4th of December.

I have been waiting and nothing has arrived.  We ordered many other
packages during this time frame for delivery and every single one was
delivered and received except this package.  If you did not have it set up
for proof of delivery with signature I am disappointed.  So, since I cannot
prove I didn't receive it except for the fact that I do not have it in
my possession, is there anything company can do to reimburse me?  Or am I
to just eat the cost of this treadmill, never to buy from your company
again.  I understand I take a risk, but since it was coming from the UK, I
would think you all have some responsibility as well.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kathy Rowan

It shows the delivery to zip code 89501 but doesn’t show what the address it was delivered too.

I have been waiting for almost 2 months to get this and would really like to receive it.

Please check into this for me.

qq,Deborah Bryant,bryant.deb@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-04,"Hello,

I think I’m having trouble making my question understood.

I want to know why the tracking shows that my package was accepted somewhere in Korea a month ago and apparently that is the end of its journey.  It was “accepted” in *Korea* a month ago.

Why is my package in Korea?  I do not have it.  My address is in the US.  Can you investigate? Or should I go ahead and tell me credit card my shipment has been stolen and to get a refund.

Does my question make sense?  

Thank you.

I never received the item. Please refund my money. The tracking below says delivered back on 12/5 – the only item I received around that time was ear buds. I ordered a piece of exercise equipment – compact treadmill, not earbuds.

qq,Susan April,rnafloat@hotmail.com,Re: Please read the emails and stop sending auto response ,2019-01-04,"Once again, you are not paying attention to the problem. I received an item that I did not order. Had no clue it had been sent in error instead of the treadmill. Therefore all I did was re-seal the envelope and write return to sender and put it in the mailbox. It wasn’t something I ordered so I returned it. I was not going to be responsible for shipping charges. Since there were absolutely no instructions inside of the envelope I had no other option. Please send me the item that I paid $139 for. If this does not occur I will be contacting my credit card company and asking them to withdraw a payment to you due to your non-compliance to resolve this matter.
This type of behavior on behalf of your company is unacceptable. I cannot believe the amount of time that I have wasted dealing with you. Immediate action as expected or I will be contacting my credit card company.

So, please send me the correct item that I ordered. I sent the wrong items back. However, I only wrote “return to sender” as there was NO paperwork inside the envelope, nor were there any instructions on how to use the earpieces.
I really want the item I ordered. If it’s not available please issue me a refund

These are not a 139.99 product

Please resend the CORRECT product – folded fitness walker

Extremely big difference – 5in x 7 in package compared to something that should be at least 24 inches or more!

Please either credit my account the 139.99 or send what I ordered.

You are not listening.  I have already clicked the link and tracked the package every time you email me.  I did NOT received the merchandise.  If you want me to release the credit card hold you must deliver the merchandise or cancel my order.  It is that simple.  Do not email me back again telling me to track the shipment.  Either email me stipulating you are resending the merchandise to the correct address or cancelling the order.  Those are the ONLY two options.

You didn't send me a treadmill second day air which I paid for....

I continue to fight your scams.  Just admit that this was a scam.  You've changed your website multiple times.  I have also worked with Facebook and see that your ads and account have been removed.

I have not received my treadmill that I ordered and paid for 2nd day air back in November.

I am continuing to work with my credit card company as clearly this is a scam.  Sending tracking information today for supposedly delivering my treadmill a month after it was ordered?  Still have not received the treadmill.

I do not have to go where you are sending me, I need my product or my refund.

You are responsible, to deliver the product you buy, or give me my refund.

but I will put an alert to the world, because you are thieves, you do fraud, you are not loyal people, you are not reliable, you are cheaters.

You know, do not send me to that site to investigate my purchase, that of investigating is up to you, not me.

I just want my product that I buy or my refund.

I wrote to them claiming, because those steps already cancel me from doing them, and says that the package
It was delivered and that is false, here in my house has never been that problem, I always receive what I buy.
and the product of you I have not received, so I demand my package or my money, or is this a fraud on your part ?.

you know, do not tell me to follow those steps
that with that nothing is resolved, I want my purchase.

Hi!
I have tracked my number and it shows that I have got my product! But it is not what I ordered!
You have sent me some cheap headsets instead of ""Folded fitness equipment"" for $ 139,99 (product weight should be approx. 28kg)!
You changed my order by yourself and have sent me some useless headsets that I don't need!
I paid $139,99 for folded fitness equipment and in reality got headsets for $5! Pls. explain me the substitution of my order!

How would a treadmill that is at least 5x 3 feet fit into my mailbox that hold letters and other postals. I have received NOTHING. How can a company advertise on Instagram with everything being false and fraudulent. My Visa was charged in London, GB, yet you originate in China?Or is it Korea? None the less, I will continue posting all over Social Media to alert all to stay clear of any and all products associated with your so- called company, SOLOPOPGO ? This is false advertising, stealing money, deceptive and grossly misrepresented. My attorney will be in touch. Be well,

qq,Frank Molinaro,registers@frankmolinaro.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-04,"Hello,

Thank you for your email. I would understand the refund policy if I
received the item that I purchased but I did not receive the item that was
purchased. Instead I received an item that I did not purchase and is worth
$134.99 dollars less then the item I purchased. If you do not want to
refund my money for the item I received since you have a policy to return
it, then fine, I will keep the $5.00 item I received, refund the money for
the item that I purchased and did not receive, refund the $134.99 (139.99 -
5.00 for the item I did receive) as there is nothing in your refund policy
for that.

If necessary, I can send you a picture of the item received, the declared
price on the package to prove to you the item price so that you may refund
my $134.99.

Just to be clear, nothing in your refund policy addresses this issue so
please refund me or provide me the proper item that I ordered.

Thank you,

It says the package was delivered on Dec 12, but that is not correct.  I
did not receive a folding treadmill - which is the product I ordered.  I
think maybe the wrong item was sent, as I did receive some wireless
headphones around that time, but wasn't aware those came from you, because
there was very little information in the package, and I couldn't tell who
it was shipped from.  If you can confirm that you shipped me headphones by
mistake, I am very happy to return them, as they are still unopened and
unused, but I need to get an update on when my folding treadmill will be
shipped.
Thanks for your help.

be disputing the charge in my credit card, filing a compliant with the
Better Business Bureau and with US customs.

qq,Vicky Wright Hunt,vwhunt@yahoo.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-04," I would be happy to return what was sent to me, if you would be so kind to issue me a return address label.  There was no packing list and it looks like the label was put on top of another label to ship it to me.  And this is now what I ordered, so I'm not sure what the ""refund procedure"" is.  The bottom line is that this is not what I ordered as you can see by my previous email and the pictures I have attached.  Therefore, I would like a refund to my credit card for the amount of the purchase.

holding a package for me. However I will check with them and show them the
tracking information which says it was delivered to the post office in
Crown Point, Indiana. I'll be very surprised if this is so.  I'll let you
know.
Again, thank you for your help.

You have already told me 3 times that my shipment has shipped and tracking has told me it has delivered and I haven`t received it. I do not want this shipment any longer, please do not ship I do not want to wait another 7-15 days for this shipment as I have waited 2 months already, please refund my money.

 

Below is what happens now when I type in my email address.  There is no reason why you cannot stop the shipment and process the refund. I will start an investigation on this through the authorities if you do not refund the money on my credit card.

 

If the logistics status has not been shown，we are packing and have not started shipping, we expect you to receive the goods within 7-15 days, please wait，thanks for your patience thank you

attached).... they have no other records to indicate delivery like the
website link you sent. If the item is not to be delivered, they advised me
to seek refund from vendor. It has been almost 60 days since I ordered the
treadmill I wanted and all I have are some emails from your company that it
was delivered and no resolution. Please contact me at your earliest

I never received the item. Please refund my money. The tracking below says delivered back on 12/5 – the only item I received around that time was ear buds. I ordered a piece of exercise equipment – compact treadmill, not earbuds.

You are not listening or understanding.  I checked the link.  The link shows the packaged delivered, however it does NOT show the address it delivered too.  I did NOT RECEIVE the merchandise ordered.  There is nothing to return to your company.  I will not pay for merchandise I did not receive.  If you want to send a new package to the correct address, I will release the credit card to pay you for the merchandise. I will not release the credit card until the purchased item is RECEIVED at my home like I ordered.

the EMS tracking number you gave me is of no use to them. Will still have
no package and no way to find out where it was delivered.  I am not happy.
If you can get me additional information and a USA tracking number, maybe
that would help.

So, please send me the correct item that I ordered. I sent the wrong items back. However, I only wrote “return to sender” as there was NO paperwork inside the envelope, nor were there any instructions on how to use the earpieces.
I really want the item I ordered. If it’s not available please issue me a refund

This is what I ordered for $139.99

This is the crap that I received, and sent back “return to sender”



<CFAC610B@DCC1B20C.12E72D5C>

These are not a 139.99 product

Please resend the CORRECT product – folded fitness walker

Extremely big difference – 5in x 7 in package compared to something that should be at least 24 inches or more!

Please either credit my account the 139.99 or send what I ordered.
This is ridiculous!!!!!!!!

However, I only wrote “return to sender” as there was NO paperwork inside the envelope, nor were there any instructions on how to use the earpieces.
I really want the item I ordered. If it’s not available please issue me a refund

This is what I ordered for $139.99

This is the crap that I received, and sent back “return to sender”



<CFAC610B@DCC1B20C.12E72D5C>

These are not a 139.99 product

Please resend the CORRECT product – folded fitness walker

Extremely big difference – 5in x 7 in package compared to something that should be at least 24 inches or more!

Please either credit my account the 139.99 or send what I ordered.
This is ridiculous!!!!!!!!

Thank you for responding to my email. I understand that you are sending me the tracking information. The tracking information you sent me shows that I already received my shipment. However, although it says that I have received it, I have not yet received my shipment.  
Could you please check with your shipper and look into this matter further. I would greatly appreciate the assistance.

I need my purchase, I never arrive,
do not send me to that tracking site
that does not solve anything with that
my product did not arrive at my house, you
are responsible for delivering it and investigating
where is my product.

so I hope you will give me the delivery of my product.

Thank you

qq,Frank Molinaro,registers@frankmolinaro.com,Re: Order Notification,2019-01-03,"Hello Support,

I ordered an item through your website called ""Folded fitness equipment""
which was $139.99. On December 7th per the tracking in the below email, the
item had ""arrived"" at my delivery address. Only thing is that the item that
was delivered were wireless earbuds which according to the package were
declared at $5.00. Can you please either deliver the correct item or refund
my money?

The order number was 5778. I can send you pictures of the item delivered,
the price declared on it, the origination email with proof of purchase
item. I can even send you a screenshot of the charge from your website on
my credit card. I would rather not have to go through the hassle of going
through the credit card company. Please assist in resolving this issue

Thank you,

Frank

qq,Frances Mitok,fmitok@yahoo.com,Re: Order #2099 confirmed,2019-01-03," Hello -I am writing again about order #2099. I just received a package in the mail, but it is not what I ordered.Order #2099 was for a Folded Fitness Equipment/treadmill. I received some wrist tracker. See attached photo for what I received. Additionally, attached is a .pdf version of the original order showing what I did purchase - which is also at the beginning of this email conversation.  
Since this item is completely wrong, I now request a full refund of the purchase price of $139.99 for the item I did not receive. Please process that refund immediately.

recognize that tracking number, and the only service that worked (this one:

ago, which is not accurate.  I definitely did not receive the folding
treadmill I purchased, so would like to confirm that the tracking number is
accurate and also that correct item was shipped.  If not, can you please
ship a folding treadmill to me immediately?  I ordered this item on
November 11, almost full two months ago at this point, so it's unacceptable
that I still can't even get correct information about if/when it was
shipped.  Please help!

I disputed the payment with my credit card, because I NEVER received the
merchandise. Your tracking system says it was delivered but does not provide
the actual address.  It was not delivered to my house.  The delivery service
should be requesting a signature upon delivery so you know the goods were
actually delivered.  I will not remove the dispute until the goods are
delivered.

I still cannot track this order it’s not found.   Why don’t you track it and see for your self .
Highly disappointed in this order it was supposed to been here before Christmas  well in hopes it was.
Tracked it so many times with no information.  ( your order is ready to ship or has shipped now there no update)
I will reject this when it shows to my door and you can take it back
Please advise  or maybe can pick up the phone and call maybe like a support team would do.

The tracking number for the above order is LM 2168 202 CN and it states that it was delivered on the 24/11/2018.  I have not received it as it was not delivered to me.  The last point on the tracking was CR3 6XX   which is the Royal Mail Sorting Office at CATERHAM UK.  All they can show is that it was delivered on 24/11/2018 WARLINGHAM but have not got a record of the address.  Would you please state what address was shown on the parcel and also parcel size and weight.

As the item have been lost in transit/not delivered to the correct destination the Royal Mail require the sender to make the inquiry and follow up what has happened to this.  Please would you do so as I would very much like to receive this item or a replacement.

PLEASE DO NOT SEND AN AUTOMATED REPLY AS THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE SITUATION.  I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH END UP REQUESTING YOU TO TAKE ACTION.

I am extremely irritated with this process.  I would like someone to contact me immediately regarding this!  I cannot just throw away the price paid for this item and you wouldn't either.  It says delivered, where was it delivered to!  I went to the office at my complex  3 times now, I do not have any packages that have been delivered for me awaiting pick up.  Please just refund me my money as I paid for expedited and didn't get it that way, and now I am still waiting for this product since November 15, 2018.  Please advise!

You billed me twice for this merchandise on my card on November 13, 2018. I contacted you on this day and said i didn't know if the first order went threw because i did not get a reply and told you i only wanted one to please cancel the first order.  You agreed and said you fixed this. Now today December 30th I get an email that it was delivered on December 17th. 2018.   The only item that was delivered to my address was a pair of ear buds. No treadmill.  I have cameras all over my house and went back and looked at the cameras and nothing was delivered to my home, and a folding treadmill does not fold up enough to fit in my mail box.  I did report this to my credit card company.  I was really looking forward to this treadmill, told everyone i know about it. But looks like i should have read the reviews before i ordered it.  The reviews say it is a great item if you get it.  The company that is shipping the item is fraud, they do not ship items and charge twice.   I do hope this is not true. please refund my order for one and ship the item or refund both fees and ship nothing.

this matter needs to be solved asap.
if you cannot deliver items to the correct place you have no business being

admit you did not send it and refund my money.  just as simple as that

do not send me anymore track your package crap.  you cannot get it through

NO ONE wants to give me an answer as to where it is. It is not at my

nothing to say it has even been delivered., you do not leave a treadmill at
someone mailbox for someone to steal,
the post office has never received a treadmill for this address
this matter needs to be taken care of now not later
I have never in my life delt with a company that will not answer or even
attempt   to tell you where this item is.
find it or
refund the money .
The tracking info you sent was not for a treadmill. someone fix this
problem one way or another
email me with a person answering this not a email saying what to do when
you cannot get it to work
You owe me 149.99 dollars PERIOD

You are avoiding my question
Where is my order I have not received a treadmill  the 149.99 cleared my
bank 11-11  I sent you proof
Now where is my treadmill?  what was sent I do not know but it was not a
treadmill and you need to send it now.
You say an order was sent to  me and it was not the treadmill. Why can you
not find it or give me an answer without me having to do it myself. Never
ever heard of a company not trying to help the customer.
If you cannot find my order 4187 refund me my money, I paid and have
nothing for it,

Thank you for the slightly condensing reply to my enquiry. Being referred to as 'dear' for simply requesting how long my order will take to arrive was not appreciated. Having seen your product advertised on Instagram I was excited about this product and was intending to gift this to my father for Christmas. I am assuming that it will not arrive before Christmas?

I understand that I need to be 'patient, but considering I ordered this item over a month ago I am sure you can understand my concerns of how long it will take to arrive.

qq,Alberto Pazzi,albertopazzi@me.com,Re: Order Notification,2018-12-29,"
On the 6th of November 2018, I ordered a Folded Fitness Equipment with logistic tracking number as follows: UE685816663YP at “Solopopgo”. I paid $139.99

Unfortunately, your shipping service has not performed well and inadequately because I received a pair of fake AirPods instead of what I had purchased. I am disappointed because it was billed the right amount for the fitness equipment but didn’t received anything. Furthermore it was supposed to be a Christmas gift, that of course, I couldn’t give anymore. 

To resolve the problem, I would appreciate either your money refunded or the shipping of the real item purchased.

 Enclosed are copies (do not send originals) of my records, including receipt of the order, the shipping tracking and the photo of the package.  

I look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem.I would like to have this problem fixed quickly please.

Please contact me at the above address.


Sincerely, 

Alberto Pazzi

Have a good day~  "
qq,Gayle MacBride,gaallyn@gmail.com,Re: AutoReply: Re: Order Notification,2018-12-28,"Please read my previous email and this email.  Your response is a form
letter and did not address any of my questions or comments and is of no
help.
I.  Your first option (1. Track your package. You can click here and enter
your email address: www.oiele.com/tracking/express)  requires downloading
an invasive software onto my computer.  This I will not do.  I will need
you to track it and inform me of the shipping status or give me a link that
works and doesn't require a download.
2.  In your original email you listed three other options for tracking the
shipment which either gave incorrect information or could not locate the
tracking number.
     Option 1.  This option said that the package was delivered on December
3, 2018.  It was not delivered to my address which was the shipping address
on the order.
     Option 2 and Option 3: Neither option could find the tracking number.
3.  Refund:  I do not have the product.  It was never delivered.  Therefore
I cannot return it.  There seems to be a problem with your identifying the
status of the shipment and letting me know where it is in the shipping
process.  Again, your option for tracking is unacceptable as it requires
downloading an invasive software.  It may be in transit.  All I want is
accurate tracking information without having to download an invasive
program.

So please understand.  This order was placed in October.  It is now the end
of December and I have not received the product.  Your company cannot or
will not give me tracking information I can use, that will not put
questionable software on my computer, or provide me with a tracking options
that works.  If this confusion, misinformation and unacceptable tracking
program continues with no results, I will ask for a refund.  The problem is
that I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE ITEM ORDERED, and you have not or cannot
provide me with good tracking information including a safe tracking
program.  The link you recommend doesn't appear to be a safe option.

At this point, the order appears to be a failed effort.  I have paid for a
product that you have not delivered to me.  In an attempt to resolve this,
please provide me with a safe option for tracking.  Do not send this link (
www.oiele.com/tracking/express) as it is invasive and not safe.  I do not
trust it and I do not want it on my computer.  You could locate the
shipment and let me know where it is, how it will be delivered and when it
will be delivered and who will deliver it.  If a local company (UPS, FedEx)
will deliver, I may be able to track it through them.  Please let me know.
If you cannot provide accurate information and a good estimate of delivery,
then I will request a refund because you have not delivered the product or
given me good, safe tracking information.  I expect to hear from you with
accurate meaningful information-- please look into this problem and do not
send you formula response.  It only tells me you have not made an attempt
to do anything to resolve this issue.

I hope to hear from you soon.

4) Noverber 13, 2018 - Solopopgo Site disappeared.

5) Noverber 13, 2018 - Solopopgo domain changed.

6) Noverber 22, 2018 - Begin shipment.

7) December 06, 2018 - I get a different product than what I ordered.

I ordered folded fitness equipment and received fake airpods. How should we

Please respond as soon as possible.

I intend to raise a open dispute through a payment card company.

qq,Gayle MacBride,gaallyn@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2018-12-27,"Order 22331 from Solopopgo, folding exercise equipment.

In addition to the reply email just sent to you a minute or so ago.

The one package tracking link says the item was delivered to my mailbox.
That is impossible.  The item ordered weighs over 60 pounds and is too
large to fit into my dmailbox.  That report is erroneous.

The first tracking link in the first paragraph requires setting up this
tracking service in google by adding an extension which allows this service
to take over all such service on my computer.  I do not upload such
services.  I do not appreciate having to upload an invasive program in
order to track my order.  Please provide actual shipping and delivery
information regarding my order.

qq,Gayle MacBride,gaallyn@gmail.com,Re: Order Notification,2018-12-27,"One December 26, 2018, I received the message I'm responding to.  It
notifies me that the item on order 2231 has shipped.  However, all but one
of the link references given for tracking this shipment cannot find the
tracking number in their system.  One said the package was delivered
December 3, 2018. The tracking number on that notice is: UE685135308YP-[
*XM9J87258224*]-LN348442853KR.  This product was never delivered no my
house-- I have not received it.  The other delivery services listed cannot
find the the tracking number for this item shown in you email.   Plus your
message today said that the item has just shipped.  Very confusing.

Either:  Order 2231 has just shipped... or it was delivered somewhere on
12/03/2018 (December 3, 2018) as stated in the No1 line:
http://track.y256.com.cn/en-US/.  The item was not delivered to my address,
the address on my order.

Please follow up on this issue and let me know the real location of this
order.  Was it delivered to some other address? Where was it actually
delivered-- I would need to see actual delivery documents and address
including a map.  If it was not delivered, why is it shown as delivered.
Why is it that the two other links given cannot locate the order.  The
shipper  should be able to trace the shipment all the way through to its
final destination which is my address.

Please let me know the true status of this shipment and why the conflicting
information regarding the shipment.  If it is lost, or was delivered to a
wrong address, please issue a credit for the amount I paid when I order
this item on order 2231.

I will appreciate a quick response.

As you know the only product that I have received it was the gift that you
have sent (image attached). I have ordered and paid (photos attached) a
walking pad but until now I didn´t receive it from you. I already report
this situation to my bank.

I will wait for an answer from you until tomorrow. After that period I will
report this situation to the Portuguese, Chinese and Singapore Legal

this tracker is showing that some something was delive4red in my mailbox
and a treadmill will not fit into a mailbox.

At this point, I consider this as a fraudulent transaction and will begin
to take action with my credit card company and the better business bureau.


Also, no I understand I I received the wireless earbuds I did not order.

qq,,susan@eberhardt.com,Re: Order Notification,2018-12-27,"None of the tracking information you provided yields any results. One
example:

Your tracking info was not found, Possible reasons:
1: The carrier hasn't accepted your package yet.
2: The carrier hasn't scanned and entered your package tracking
information into their system yet.
3: Your tracking number is incorrect or invalid.
4: Your tracking number has expired and removed from carrier's system.
The number maybe belongs to: YANWEN [1] 
 When I click on the YANWEN link it says the item was delivered but that
is not true. It looks like a made-up tracking list. Please provide a
refund.

The tracking email says that it was delivered December 8th. I did not
receive it. It said it was delivered at my mailbox. It is not possible for
this package inside my mailbox because it is a community mailbox outside.
If it was left outside of the mailbox then it would have been stolen. I
have not received it and it said the package was delivered. I would like my
money back because I do not have what I ordered.

I did not receive the treadmill that I originally ordered from y'all.
Instead you sent me Bluetooth wireless headphones. I would like to get in
contact with someone about this matter because you charged me $140 dollars
for the treadmill I did not receive.

Folded fitness equipment × 1

I was charged $140 US, but what was delivered was was a pair of i7s tws
knock off airpods, which retail for $10 on Amazon.

Either your company, or the reseller (darixinkiem@gmail.com), has done
something wrong.  I have already contacted my credit card company to alert
them of this.

received the order or any notification order was sent or arrived until I
requested from my credit card company about the fraud company practices. It
was not delivered to our billing address which is the same as the mailing
address. It was not put in our mail box for it is to large of an item to be
delivered there. There was no notification of any package waiting for us to
pick up.
I have requested my money be returned for no delivery of product and that
your company is investigated for fraud business practice.
This tracking information is a joke.
Please refund my money if your company is a trust worthy company to restore
your value to your business.

The one site http://track.yw56.com.cn/en-US/ shows as delivered on 12/7.
I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY walking pad. The order was for fitness equipment.
I did get a pair of pod headphones around that time.
THIS IS NOT WHAT WAS ORDERED.
I am not paying $140.00 for a 10 dollar pair of headphones.
I will be disputing this charge with my credit card-company.

wasn't received.  I had ordered a treadmill, which would have been shipped
in a huge box.  I know the tracking info is fake because it says the item
was delivered in the mailbox.  We all know that a treadmill cannot fit in a
mailbox, or that a USPS mail carrier would attempt to deliver such a bulky
item in their mail truck.  I also have USPS informed delivery which would
have notified me of an item such as this. I got scammed.

qq,,abrody@macmaps.com,Re: Order Notification,2018-12-27,"
Hi Solopopgo,
Is that what I received from Korea?   I received a package around that time frame, which I never ordered.  Inside of it was a set of earbuds, which I never ordered with no English markings other than it was from Korea, and some non-descript company name’s Earbuds.  Solopopgo was not on the package.  I paid for a treadmill.   
Based on your reputation, I thought I would never receive the order since you also never responded to inquiries until now.    So I disputed the charge.    I have no means of contacting anyone in Korea.   

Next time respond in the next two days after making an order with a confirmation.
Fix your website so it is possible to get an accurate reading of what the order was that was placed.
Fix your communication system so people can reach you in the U.S.
I have already ordered and received a treadmill from someone else.  So you can cancel my treadmill order if you can find it.   I sent inquiries over a month ago as to the status of my order.  No response.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
Abraham Brody

qq,"Wulfekuhler, Marilyn",wulfekuh@msu.edu,Re: Order Notification,2018-12-26,"Your tracking information is garbage.  3 out of 4 links failed to show anything.  The one that did, showed the merchandise had been delivered December 18, which it most definitely did not.  I also canceled this order on December 15 when I saw nothing but empty space in the link provided for ""checking my order"".  I have initiated reversal of charges with my credit card company, since your company seems to be one giant scam.  A ""reply to"" which consists of a gmail address is a big clue, which is why I canceled the order two weeks ago.


Let me repeat, I CANCELED this order when I discovered how shady your practices were, I got no information in return, and I most certainly got no merchandise (which you are simultaneously claiming that you shipped today, and was delivered two weeks ago).  You are criminals taking people's money.


I hope you get fined, go out of business, and the people responsible go to jail.  You should be ashamed.

NO ONE wants to give me an answer as to where it is. It is not at my
mailbox.it is too big.
nothing to say it has even been delivered., you do not leave a treadmill at
someone mailbox for someone to steal,
the post office has never received a treadmill for this address
this matter needs to be taken care of now not later
I have never in my life delt with a company that will not answer or even
attempt   to tell you where this item is.
find it or
refund the money .
The tracking info you sent was not for a treadmill. someone fix this
problem one way or another

However, in early December I received a small package that contained a set

tried to find out what company sent them, but there was not a packing

I am needing you to verify that you have a record of the order being placed and the status of the delivery.
When I tried to access my account on your website, it said no purchase was made.

Thank you for the slightly condensing reply to my enquiry. Being referred to as 'dear' for simply requesting how long my order will take to arrive was not appreciated. Having seen your product advertised on Instagram I was excited about this product and was intending to gift this to my father for Christmas. I am assuming that it will not arrive before Christmas?

I understand that I need to be 'patient, but considering I ordered this item over a month ago I am sure you can understand my concerns of how long it will take to arrive.

Hello

I have tried to track my order however the link provided shows a message staying 'not found'. Please let me know the date my order will arrive. I'm concerned that the tracking link is not working and have paid a substantial amount for this product.

I await hearing from you.

qq,carlos mongalo,carlos_torrezz@live.com,Re: A shipment from order #1950 is on the way,2018-12-21,"
 enter the page, that they gave me, to see my package
and says that my package was delivered on December 14 and I have not received any package.

So you have to investigate, where is my package
or send me my package again, because I pay for it.

Thank you

qq,e,mbdirt@aol.com,Order #1184,2018-12-21,"Solopopgo,
On Nov. 14, 2018 I paid for a Walking Pad treadmill and received a confirmation of the order. 
I have written to you multiple times asking when it would be delivered, who is the freight carrier, is there a tracking number.
I did receive a tracking number eventually, and when I checked it yesterday, it said it was delivered on 12/18/18. 
IT WAS NOT DELIVERED HERE IF AT ALL. 
In doing a search for your company on Google, I found at least 2 references to this Walking Pad for $139 that said it is a SCAM. 
Unless I receive the treadmill or some legitimate explanation from you, I am going to contact the Federal Trade Administration, the Better Business Bureau, the TN Consumer Affairs Department, and put a large post on Facebook and Twitter about you cheating me out of my money and not delivering the treadmill and not answering my emails. This is the last time that I will make this request for the product or explanation.

This is the second time I have attempted to reach you regarding my order. 

I have not received the shipment that I was notified on 11/17/2018 as to being shipped.  The link in the shipment email to track package no longer works nor does the link to see order.
 
I will be notifying the fraud department of my credit card company if I do not get a timely response.

qq,Jenna Patskin,jmmpatskin@yahoo.com,Re: Order #1721 confirmed,2018-12-19,"Hello,

This message is regarding order # 1721. 
PLEASE, read my whole email.  

I DID NOT receive the item I ordered (compact treadmill). I instead received a pair of generic Apple/iPhone earbuds. According to social media, I know I am not alone in this. 

Since it is still within your arbitrary “ ‘14 days’ after delivery return policy,” despite NOT receiving the correct item, 

******I request a return/refund.******

 Be aware that I also initiated fraud services from my bank, Bank of America, on 12/12/2018 due to receiving the INCORRECT item. I know I am not alone in this. 

I understand that I received a manufactured tracking email that mirrors the exact same route for the original number that was the earbuds. Also, the United States Post Office does not have the tracking information for ‘UE687576033YP’ in any form. They only have tracking information for ‘LN360462365KR’ which serves as evidence that the tracking information for ‘UE687576033YP’ on your ‘Tracking More/ Yanwen Tracking’ website is COMPLETELY FALSIFIED.

This message is regarding order # 1721.

I originally sent this second email to which you’ve responded after receiving what I believe was an INCORRECT item from your company. I received a package of generic ‘iPhone’ earbuds instead of the item I actually ordered. I ordered a compact treadmill type item.

I’m almost certain this item (generic iPhone earbuds) is from your company because I peeled back many of the numerous labels on it and one has the original tracking number I was provided. 

I was originally provided tracking number: UE687576033YP and this item was received under tracking number: LN360462365KR. According to the United States Postal Service, this item originated from Korea. I further believe this is an incorrect product from your company because I haven’t made any other foreign purchases in over 70 days.

According to social media websites, I am not the only purchaser who has received earbuds or another INCORRECT product in lieu of the original purchase. 

** I request that you initiate a refund.**

Again, please assist and help correct this error. I have taken photographs of everything and I am also making sure to send and document that I sent these messages within your company’s specified return window of ‘14 days after item receipt.’

** I request that you initiate a refund.**

Also, be advised that my bank’s fraud department has been alerted.

Again, this purchase was made from solopopgo.com and I am writing regarding order #1721.

Sincerely,

Jenna Patskin

Hello. 

I'm still waiting for my order #2120 And I don't
understand why...

- I ordered It by My personal email
mattarocci.susanna@tiscali.it

 - I tried to track my package on
www.oiele.com/tracking/express and I found this: tracking-num
UE688561517YP NOT FOUND. (???)

- The payment didn't fail: It was
immediately paid from my Bank on 18th november (UNICREDIT: autorizzata
op. Internet 136,36 EUR carta *1727 c/o sailingm London E16 1AH 18/11/18
12:25) 

- I didn't change my Address

- I used a credit card for the
payment. 

Some days ago I received a product I never ordered
(Intelligence Health Bracelet) from 
Post Luxembourg ZI Krakelshaft
L-3290 Bettembourg TN 0035280028004. 

Is that Yours? I'm not interested
on It. It is NOT my purchase... 

What else should I do???

qq,Bethany Palmatier,auntieb81@gmail.com,Re: Order # 1569,2018-12-17,"So I received a package in the mail, but it is NOT what I ordered.   What I
ordered I paid almost $170.00 for & the item I received says its value is
about $10.00 (says it right on the shipping tag).   The item I received is
nothing even similar to what I ordered.

I tried the link you sent me to ""track my package"" & it now says there is
no other shipping information available (probably because the package that
was sent - containing the wrong item - was delivered).

I want the item that I ordered & paid for as it is a christmas present.  Is
it on it's way?  I can send you the original email I received when I placed
my order that shows the item that was suppose to be shipped to me, if you
want.

Not real happy with my first experience purchasing something thru your
company.

qq,Vickie,grahsmeema@gmail.com,Track order NOW,2018-12-17,"I can’t believe I was such a sucker. The farthest I got with tracking my order #1154 with your tracking number LM208230098CN. It showed MY order was successfully delivered to HUNGARY on 12/06/18 ! The order was placed 11/14/18 and “shipped” 11/17/18. And every thing went haywire from that. 
I beg you to contact me please, at grahsmeema@gmail.com! A contact was made by LIUWEI, but made no sense. I need to hear from you.

I received an email stating the product was shipped, but there was no tracking number in the email.  Can you provide me with a tracking number or tell me when the product will be delivered to my home?

Hello,
 I haven’t received my item yet. My order number is 1967. It’s for a foldable walking treadmill. It was ordered on November 15th and was supposed to be here in 7-20 days. Is there a tracking number I can have to find when it is expected to be delivered?  
Thank you,

On November 15th I ordered folding fitness equipment order #1725.  I have been billed on my Chase credit card and have yet to
receive the product.  Also made Chase aware of the situation and said I would try to find out what happened to the order.  I still want the product but
will not pay for it until it has been received.  
Sounds like a great product and am anxious to receive.  Please let me know what the current status is.

qq,Eric Cook,eric@ericcook.com,Re: AutoReply: Re: Order #1219 confirmed,2018-12-14,"Well, at least that tracking number worked. I just checked and saw that I
got something in the mail today. However, that is *NOT* what I ordered. I
ordered two folding treadmill/walking devices (you called it ""*Folded
fitness equipment*."") You can see that screenshot of a person walking on it
in the original email confirmation I got when I made my purchase.

[image: image.png]

What I got today was a single fitness tracking band that you wear on your
wrist. What happened to the two treadmills? That is nothing close to what I
had ordered and certainly not worth the $279.98 that I was charged.

[image: IMG_20181213_221140.jpg]
[image: IMG_20181213_221153.jpg]

So, this all got me thinking and I decided to look around a bit more. After
digging into this further, I see that I have been the victim of a SCAM and
you should be ashamed of yourself for duping well-intended consumers like
myself with crap like this.

https://shop.walkingpad.com/pages/name-and-shame
https://noscams.info/a-new-type-scam-on-facebook/

I will be submitting a chargeback on my credit card and taking further
action against you to keep others from getting scammed by your unethical
behavior. I cannot believe that I've spent the past several days thinking
that you were actually a legit company. You're nothing but a fraud.

Shame on you... :-(

qq,Rennell,momtosema@aol.com,Re: Tracking number ,2018-12-13,"Seems very interesting that you have given all kinds of instructions but none coincide with the other so either you have sent me my product or not... if I get my product why would I return it? Those instructions should be with the package if something is wrong... then you say payment failed- it didn’t — you took my card info and took the money—
Next you say the website is down and you are trying to fix it..... shouldn’t take a month to fix your website and now the website only shows clothes... hmmm

Then you say my address changed yet it did not so no need to go to my post office and change it...
Then you only take credit cards— well that’s what I paid with.
Then you say to go to your website that in another paragraph says is down/broken to look at product information.....

So which is the issue??  This is smelling more and more like a scam...

I received the goods you sent. But what I ordered was a walking machine, not a fake ear pot. This is consistent with the shipping number you sent, so this is probably yours. Anyway, I still want a refund.

Dear customer:
We feel very sorry for your wrong order, but our products are already in transit. Maybe you can try and experience our products. Maybe it will become a beautiful mistake. If you are still not satisfied with our products, we can return our products. We will give you a refund

I want to cancel payment of order # 4724.

Tracking number RF586320935SG could not be retrieved. If the payment is not canceled I will challenge the card company. You must cancel as soon as possible.

qq,,tylerzane5@aol.com,Fwd: order,2018-12-13,"  Does this look like the picture below. The picture below is what I bought  and this is what you sent.   What I bought was $154.99 what you sent retails for $4.99. A copy of this is going to banking fraud now and if I don't get my money back and I will be pressing charges along with them on FRAUD.

I sent the following email on 12/10/2018 at 6:12 PM EST and have yet to receive a response as of 12/12/2018 at 8:55 AM EST.

This purchase was made from solopopgo.com and I am writing regarding order #1721.

“I am inquiring as to the status of the following order, a compact treadmill/‘folded fitness equipment.’

I received confirmation that the item shipped as of 11/17/2018 at 10:32 PM EST. At the time I was provided the tracking number, UE687576033YP

As of 12/10/2018 at 6:12 PM EST, I have yet to receive any update regarding this item and the tracking number does not work and when I click the link to your website, it tells me my order is not found, ‘404 error.’

Please advise as to the whereabouts of my package. I ordered a compact treadmill/‘folded fitness equipment’ on 11/15/2018 and received confirmation of my order at 8:36 AM EST. It has been approximately 17 business days since I submitted my order and 15 business days since it was reportedly shipped.”

I sent the above message after receiving what I believe was an INCORRECT item from your company. I received a package of generic ‘iPhone’ earbuds instead of the item I actually ordered. 

Please assist and help correct this error. I am also making sure to send and document that I sent these messages within your company’s specified return window of ‘14 days after item receipt.’

Again, this purchase was made from solopopgo.com and I am writing regarding order #1721.

Sincerely,

Jenna Patskin

it to but it was not to me.  If a parcel is too big for our mailboxes, 
our carrier brings it to our house and hands it to me.  This order has 
never arrived here.  And why has it taken you a month to answer my email 
questions?  I really wanted this item, but had to dispute it with my 
credit card company as I could not get any info from you.  Check again, 
whoever told you they delivered it was lying.  IS NOT HERE!

Hi, I bought the folded fitness equipment on monday and paid for the 3 day delivery!

The amount was billed on my credit card on tuesday.

It is now thursday and not only have I not received my package (not a big deal, can have it tomorrow), but when I click on the link you sent me by email to trace my delivery I receive the mention :

The checkout page youre looking for does not exist

The URL you entered may be expired, deleted, or invalid.

Hi, I bought the folded fitness equipment on monday and paid for the 3 day delivery!

The amount was billed on my credit card on tuesday.

It is now thursday and not only have I not received my package (not a big deal, can have it tomorrow), but when I click on the link you sent me by email to trace my delivery I receive the mention :

The checkout page youre looking for does not exist

The URL you entered may be expired, deleted, or invalid.
Return to the home page to continue shopping.

Can someone please tell me what is happening and/or call me on my cellphone? 514 601-9856. Thank you!

All I get from you is the following:

Dear customer:
I'm sorry, I just checked your order, your courier will arrive soon, I'm
sorry to let you wait a long time, we will strive to improve
This is your track number:
                   Track url:https://www.trackingmore.com


The only thing I can do is click on the link, which takes me to the
TrackingMore site. But I have to enter a tracking number in order for me to
find my shipment and the one you have sent me before appears to be for a
different order to someone in Georgia.

qq,Adriano Rucchetta,thatageguy@gmail.com,Re: Order #1188,2018-12-11,"This is interesting. When I go to the email your company sent me and click check on order it shows a 404 error so I have no way to track package. Also when I purchased this it said it would be delivered December 8th I have yet to receive it. I have attached photos of the fact that I can not see the order. So if it is going to be delivered then I will try it. But I am hesitant to believe it is on its way.

I am inquiring as to the status of the following order, a compact treadmill/‘folded fitness equipment.’

I received confirmation that the item shipped as of 11/17/2018 at 10:32 PM EST. At the time I was provided the tracking number, UE687576033YP

As of 12/10/2018 at 6:12 PM EST, I have yet to receive any update regarding this item and the tracking number does not work and when I click the link to your website, it tells me my order is not found, ‘404 error.’

Please advise as to the whereabouts of my package. I ordered a compact treadmill/‘folded fitness equipment’ on 11/15/2018 and received confirmation of my order at 8:36 AM EST. It has been approximately 17 business days since I submitted my order and 15 business days since it was reportedly shipped.

Since this order has been placed, I have been unable to track this order, or get any further information.  Every attempt leads to either a 404 error, or I receive an error that reads""The checkout page you’re looking for does not existThe URL you entered may be expired, deleted, or invalid.

The order number is 3644. Please forward proof of shipping and tracking information to me immediately.

We have ordered a Folded fitness equipment last November 18th.

We received a confirmation that the order was received but it was waiting to be shipped. In the e-mail we received you wrote that we will be updated about the shipping and the expected delivery date.

We noticed that you received the payment by our credit card (so you accepted the order) but we received no information about the good delivery.

May we ask you to get us updated about the delivery status? If we do not receive a feedback from you in 2 working days we will be obliged to ask for a refunding through our credit card because the delivery time declared by you was not respected at all.

Waiting for your reply, all the best.

Hi I haven't heard back from you and the website is something else now, with clothing items. The item has not arrived, and the tracking link you sent does not work.
I will be reporting the charge as fraudulent, as well as contacting local authorities with this email and the website. 
If I am mistaken and there is a reasonable explanation to this, as well as legitimate tracking I can use to verify order status, please send it to me right away.
Best,
Marijana, order #9965

Order# 8495
 I ordered a folded treadmill for $154.99 USD on November 11, 2018, and I paid extra for express shipping to receive in 3 business days.  I still have not received this item. We are leaving the country tomorrow, and I don't want this item siting on my porch while we're gone.  Can you please trace shipment and let me know status? Did it go to my PO Box? Was it returned?

qq,Dianne Grey,dianne.grey59@gmail.com,Unhappy about no answers to my question.,2018-11-22,"On the 6th November I ordered a super weeded 1143, charged USD$164.00.
and expected confirmation of order.  Instead the link to track is error 404
and I cannot find it.

In looking through your web site, I saw the super weeker for $129.00 and
not shipping charge.

So It seems that:
1. I have not received any mower
2. I have been charged too much to the tune of $35.00 usd

Option, send the mower as promised for $129.00 USD and refund my account
$35.00 USD
OR
CANCEL THE ORDER AND REFUND ME THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF USD$164.00

I have informed  my bankers about this transaction and they want an answer
straight away, so i can advise them of the outcome.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

qq,Bertina Watkins,watkins@frazmtn.com,Where is my order??,2018-11-17,"
   I am beginning to worry that I have been scammed by your company.  On 
November 10th, I ordered the folding fitness equipment and paid $15.00 
extra for expedited shipping, which promised 3 business days for 
delivery.  It has now been over 5 business days since I ordered and 
nothing.  The link I was provided for tracking my package has now 
stopped working. I get an error message when I click on the link.  I 
need to know where my order is.  If I do not hear anything from you by 
Monday, November 19th, I will file a complaint with my credit card 
provider.  I really want the item I ordered so please, let me know where 
it is and when I will receive it.  Thank you   Bertina Watkins,  Order #

qq,Allison H,allihi72@gmail.com,status of my order requested,2018-11-17,"Hello,

I am contacting you because 11/7/18 I purchased an item from your company
and actually paid the extra $10 USD to have my item delivered in 3-7 days.
It has been over the expected time of delivery and I still have not
received my order. I am not sure why your advertisement would assure
delivery in 3-7 days when you know that you could not meet that deadline.
This is not a very sound business practice at all , so therefore, since I
have still not received the item nor have I received an update as to the
status of my order I am requesting a refund. My order number is #2731 and I
can provide you a screenshot  below of the confirmation which I received
when I placed the order showing that I paid for upgraded delivery. I expect
to hear back from you in regards to this matter as I have already contacted
the email address provided in this email which I had received but got no
reply.

Thank you for handling this matter quickly.

written that its first delivery will start not before October 2019.

How will you send a product in 7-20 days which has not been manufacturing
yet?

When I press the link of order in SMS, I receive that ""this page doesn't
exist"" message.(attached)

When I search for urban vehicle product on solopopgo, at the moment I find
no search results.(attached)

When I made order, I was able to view the product page as attached.

If you are not able to deliver this product, please refund my payment.
Otherwise I need to go to police.

I saw my order is comfirmed before I put payment information. I wanted to
see what kind of payment I can use, and if I can use Paypal, I was going to
think about if I will buy it or not, but when I click the button, the
website said the order is comfirmed already before seeing payment methods.

> How About Using WalkingPad in the Office?
> 
> 
> 
> Some Important Technical Specifications:
> 
> 
> 
> ?Walking has proven to be a factor in our heart health and general fitness. It doesn't take that much. In fact, 30 minutes a day is enough to show results.?Over time, regular walking can significantly improve your physical and mental health.
> 
> 
> ?WalkingPad's unique product design revolutionizes the traditional steel frame structure to create a fresh and brand new look, allowing WalkingPad to blend seamlessly into your home¡¯s d¨¦cor.
> 
> 
> The LED display is embedded behind the low transmittance ABS panel¡¯s surface. The panel looks completely bare when WalkingPad is turned off and has a crystal clear glow when WalkingPad is turned on.
> 
> 
> ?WalkingPad¡¯s frame structure is composed of aluminum alloy to maximize its integrity, capacity and endurance. Aluminum alloy is incredibly strong but also lightweight. Our choice of material allows WalkingPad to be easy to move and store.
> 
> 
> ?WalkingPad¡¯s low profile raises it only 57mm / 2.24 inches off the ground. This minimizes the step-up height and by extension, mitigates the risk of falling off of the walking surface. The compact design and minimal floor clearance makes for a quieter experience.
> 
> 
> Our patented ¡°double fold¡± technology cuts WalkingPad¡¯s required storage space in half. You can easily pull WalkingPad out for a quick walk and then, just as easily, fold it up and hide it away.?
> 
> Watch WalkingPad Fold & Roll with Ease!
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Unfolding WalkingPad is quick and easy
> 
> ?There are two transportation wheels conveniently located underneath WalkingPad. These wheels, combined with WalkingPad¡¯s lightweight body, make it extremely easy to move WalkingPad around. The orange accents add subtle flair to WalkingPad¡¯s minimalist design.
> 
> 
> ?WalkingPad is so compact that it can be stored in nearly any corner of your home. Storing WalkingPad never becomes a burden the way that bulkier exercise equipment can be.
> 
> 
> 
> See automatic mode in motion
> WalkingPad has two exercise modes - M, manual mode, and A, automatic mode. When you start out, you can use the remote control to operate WalkingPad in manual mode. Once you're more comfortable with WalkingPad, you can control the speed through our patented Adaptive Speed Control system. In this mode, you walk at your own desired pace and WalkingPad can adapt its speed to suit you. (Walk more toward the top of the belt to speed up and walk more toward the bottom to slow down)

qq,Shelly Dunford,shellydunford@yahoo.com,Cancel order,2018-11-13,"Hello,

My debit card was charged for $279.98 on 11/11/18.  This was an error.  Please cancel my order and refund my debit card.

What happened was … I was trying to purchase 2 of the walking pads, but every card I entered for payment, I would get a notification that payment failed.  This happened 5 times.  So, I believed that none of the orders went through.  I never got an email saying that one was processed successfully.  So, I ended up going to my local Walmart and purchasing 2 treadmills.  I don’t need the walking pads now.  Please cancel the order and refund my purchase.  I do not have an order number or receipt to send you because I never received one.  All I have is the charge for $279.98 on my bank statement.

Thank you,
Shelly Dunford

you please stop one of those as I only want to order one of the walking

I wanted to purchase your folded fitness treadmill you have on sale for $139.99order# 6673But saw this on google ( see below ) 
What guarantee do I have that once I place my order with you...I will receive what I ordered?Now a days its so hard to trust anyone. 

Recently I can see almost every day a new scam campaign by a Facebook scam gang. They take some images from the web, often from Kickstarter, Indiegogo etc. – and they sell it at ridiculous low prices. Of course buyers will never get anything. Please let me know in case you see sites I should add here:
coolerones.com
cooldab.com
ebikemalls.com
elegpia.com (already taken down)
freehue.com
greatfixo.com
hootcostore.com
itstylish.co
iutubuy.com
next2day.com
poyfind.com
rena1ssance.com
sailingme.com
sharkpopin.com
solopopgo.com
worth-shop.com

You can see that all websites have the same style and largely the same products. This is one criminal gang that comes out with a few new websites every week.
